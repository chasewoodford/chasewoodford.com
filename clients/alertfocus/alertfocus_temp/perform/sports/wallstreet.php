From the World Cup to youth tennis, a training fad<BR>emerges; the science of finding the zone<BR>By RUSSELL ADAMS<BR>July 29, 2006;&nbsp;Page&nbsp;P1<BR><BR>Members of Italy's World Cup-winning soccer team have done it. A <BR>starting quarterback in the NFL has tried it out. And so has Jordan <BR>Kreuter, an 18-year-old golfer in North Carolina.<BR><BR>The thing they have in common: They've all turned to neurofeedback, a <BR>technique that promises to help athletes reprogram their brains so they <BR>can reach a zone of relaxed concentration during clutch situations.<BR><BR>Long used to treat medical conditions such as attention deficit <BR>hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy and dementia, it is beginning to <BR>emerge as a tool for pro and amateur athletes alike -- with <BR>neurofeedback machines even starting to show up at some local public <BR>golf courses.<BR>Mind Games: Several members of Italy's World Cup-winning team, <BR>including Andrea Pirlo, second from lower left, did extensive <BR>neurofeedback in the runup to the tournament.<BR><BR>This technique is bringing some science to the mental side of <BR>athletics, a field also known as sports psychology, which has often <BR>been derided by many players and trainers as hokum. In neurofeedback, <BR>athletes strap on electrodes that measure brainwaves. They then try to <BR>learn how to control spikes in those brainwaves, which may signify <BR>distractions going on inside their heads, such as obsessing about a <BR>past performance. Critics say it's one thing to be able to manipulate a <BR>bunch of lines moving across a screen, but it's another to remain <BR>perfectly calm as a fastball zooms toward you at 100 miles per hour or <BR>network cameras hover over your par putt.<BR><BR>As a veteran sports reporter who has seen many training fads come and <BR>go, I was curious to try it out. Wiring myself up to a neurofeedback <BR>machine, I spent two hours working my way through everything from <BR>complicated math computations to techniques for slowing my heart rate. <BR>It was far more grueling than I had envisioned. But it gave me some <BR>appreciation for what it feels to be more focused -- and for how stress <BR>and pressure can hijack your brain.<BR><BR>In one exercise, the goal was to use the power of concentration to move <BR>two mice forward across a computer screen. Just when I was starting to <BR>have some success, I was interrupted by a phone call from my editor, <BR>who was calling to burden me with more work. For the next five minutes, <BR>I couldn't even keep the mice from back-pedaling. (See this story for <BR>more details on my neurofeedback experience1.<WBR>)<BR><BR>Neurofeedback'<WBR>s big claim to fame so far is its little-publicized <BR>connection to this year's World Cup. In February, months before the <BR>tournament started, some of Italy's best soccer players, including a <BR>handful who would later play in the Cup, began spending much of their <BR>practice time in a small room in Milan furnished with six luxury <BR>leather recliners facing a glass wall.<BR>FIRST PERSON<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Our reporter tries&nbsp;neurofeedback and learns from computer-animated <BR>mice that he has a "busy brain."<BR><BR>On the other side of the glass Bruno De Michelis, head of the sports <BR>science lab for AC Milan, one of the country's top professional teams, <BR>monitored a bank of six computer screens wired to a system made by <BR>Thought Technology Ltd., a Canadian company. The screens showing how <BR>each player's brain responded to stressful situations. Some players, <BR>the data showed, were nervous about doing mental exercises in front of <BR>their teammates, while others either had trouble winding down after a <BR>match or winding up before one. In the following weeks, the players <BR>spent hours working on these issues through a series of exercises that <BR>resembled computer games, with the brain as the joystick.<BR><BR>Mr. De Michelis says a tremendous amount of energy in soccer games goes <BR>to waste because players lose concentration during key moments, like <BR>penalty kicks. "I call this useless suffering," he says. "We can't do <BR>magic here, but it can be of some help."<BR><BR>Having the ability to tune out distractions during competition -- known <BR>as having a "quiet mind" -- is one of the holy grails of sports. Jocks <BR>believe that the capacity to have extreme concentration during <BR>stressful moments gives you a big edge, whether it's a basketball <BR>player staying focused on the hoop while thousands of fans are waving <BR>their arms in the background, or a tennis player learning not to berate <BR>himself for a bad shot.<BR><BR>To help Tiger Woods learn to block out distractions during critical <BR>moments, his late father, Earl, used to jingle change in his pocket, <BR>drop golf bags and roll balls across his son's line of vision. Golfer <BR>Se Ri Pak's father used a different approach to make her mentally <BR>tougher. When she was a child, he took her to pit-bull fights and <BR>Korean cemeteries at night.<BR><BR>Until now, neurofeedback has mostly been confined to medical <BR>environments. Sufferers of attention deficit disorder, for example, <BR>have been found to have reduced activity in parts of the brain. <BR>Neurofeedback teaches them how to produce brainwave patterns that speed <BR>up those slow brainwaves. But brain-training has rarely been tried on <BR>healthy people, mainly because of doubts about its utility and its high <BR>cost, which can be as much as $200 an hour.<BR><BR>Over the last decade, university researchers and some of the companies <BR>that make neurofeedback devices have begun to dabble in the sports <BR>world, including helping Olympians like Austrian skier Hermann Maier.<BR><BR>Many of these same athletes have already had experience with a <BR>technique called biofeedback. Biofeedback differs from neurofeedback in <BR>that it focuses on controlling physiological responses to stress (like <BR>a fast heart rate and extreme muscle tension) as opposed to <BR>neurological responses. (To confuse matters, neurofeedback is sometimes <BR>referred to as EEG biofeedback.<WBR>)<BR><BR>Proponents of neurofeedback say retraining your brain, as futuristic as <BR>it sounds, is now possible because scientists know precisely which <BR>brainwave frequencies correspond with optimal levels of focus. All a <BR>person has to do is learn how to achieve those same frequencies by <BR>practicing, they say.<BR><BR>But not all the kinks have been worked out yet, according to some <BR>people who have used the neurofeedback devices. Vietta Wilson, who has <BR>trained some Canadian track-and-field Olympians, says some of the <BR>devices she has tried pick up radio stations instead of brain waves. <BR>Another potential problem, according to some researchers: Some of the <BR>same devices track brainwaves in a particular part of the brain called <BR>the executive center -- but altering brainwaves there can trigger <BR>depression in certain people. Several device manufacturers say neither <BR>of those problems has been an issue with their products.<BR><BR>In the last five years, neurofeedback has become the focus of studies <BR>in some top medical and psychology journals. In general, they bolster <BR>the case that it's possible to retrain the brain.<BR><BR>Last fall, Canada's governing body of tennis put some of its top 20 <BR>youth players through neurofeedback. And McGill University in Montreal <BR>and the National Coaching Institute of Montreal have committed to a <BR>five-year study to test neurofeedback on the region's top 80 athletes <BR>in sports ranging from hockey to racquetball.<BR><BR>For high-school football player Michael Dell'Aquila, neurofeedback was <BR>part of a plan to gain an edge with college scouts. At the time, Mr. <BR>Dell'Aquila, a skilled defensive back, had already received letters of <BR>interest from dozens of colleges. But he was concerned about his <BR>ability to perform in front of recruiters day after day. Specifically, <BR>he wanted to learn how to clear his mind of the previous day's <BR>performance. So last spring, while he was finishing his junior year at <BR>Avon Old Farms prep school in Avon, Conn., he signed up with a nearby <BR>practitioner.<BR><BR>Over the course of about 10 sessions, he worked on boosting his <BR>concentration by trying to propel a rocket forward with his mind. If <BR>his focus drifted and he either began daydreaming or listening to his <BR>inner critic, different-colored rockets associated with those brain <BR>states would creep forward and begin to overtake his rocket. The <BR>sessions also showed that Mr. Dell'Aquila wasn't getting enough <BR>connectivity between the two hemispheres of his brain. So every night <BR>during the summer he listened to 30 minutes of specially engineered <BR>music. Mr. Dell'Aquila will play football for Boston College beginning <BR>this fall. Gio Valiante, a sports psychologist to a number of top <BR>golfers including Justin Leonard and Chris DiMarco, says neurofeedback <BR>will one day be the norm for PGA Tour pros. But he says he's not about <BR>to strap anything onto his clients until these devices are rigorously <BR>tested on amateur players.<BR>
