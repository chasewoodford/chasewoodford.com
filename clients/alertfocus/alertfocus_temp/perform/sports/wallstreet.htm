<p><span class="page">From the World Cup to youth tennis, a training fad<br>emerges; the science of finding the zone<br>By RUSSELL ADAMS<br>July 29, 2006;&nbsp;Page&nbsp;P1<br><br>Members of Italy's World Cup-winning soccer team have done it. A <br>starting quarterback in the NFL has tried it out. And so has Jordan <br>Kreuter, an 18-year-old golfer in North Carolina.<br><br>The thing they have in common: They've all turned to neurofeedback, a <br>technique that promises to help athletes reprogram their brains so they <br>can reach a zone of relaxed concentration during clutch situations.<br><br>Long used to treat medical conditions such as attention deficit <br>hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy and dementia, it is beginning to <br>emerge as a tool for pro and amateur athletes alike -- with <br>neurofeedback machines even starting to show up at some local public <br>golf courses.<br>Mind Games: Several members of Italy's World Cup-winning team, <br>including Andrea Pirlo, second from lower left, did extensive <br>neurofeedback in the runup to the tournament.<br><br>This technique is bringing some science to the mental side of <br>athletics, a field also known as sports psychology, which has often <br>been derided by many players and trainers as hokum. In neurofeedback, <br>athletes strap on electrodes that measure brainwaves. They then try to <br>learn how to control spikes in those brainwaves, which may signify <br>distractions going on inside their heads, such as obsessing about a <br>past performance. Critics say it's one thing to be able to manipulate a <br>bunch of lines moving across a screen, but it's another to remain <br>perfectly calm as a fastball zooms toward you at 100 miles per hour or <br>network cameras hover over your par putt.<br><br>As a veteran sports reporter who has seen many training fads come and <br>go, I was curious to try it out. Wiring myself up to a neurofeedback <br>machine, I spent two hours working my way through everything from <br>complicated math computations to techniques for slowing my heart rate. <br>It was far more grueling than I had envisioned. But it gave me some <br>appreciation for what it feels to be more focused -- and for how stress <br>and pressure can hijack your brain.<br><br>In one exercise, the goal was to use the power of concentration to move <br>two mice forward across a computer screen. Just when I was starting to <br>have some success, I was interrupted by a phone call from my editor, <br>who was calling to burden me with more work. For the next five minutes, <br>I couldn't even keep the mice from back-pedaling. (See this story for <br>more details on my neurofeedback experience1.<wbr>)<br><br>Neurofeedback'<wbr>s big claim to fame so far is its little-publicized <br>connection to this year's World Cup. In February, months before the <br>tournament started, some of Italy's best soccer players, including a <br>handful who would later play in the Cup, began spending much of their <br>practice time in a small room in Milan furnished with six luxury <br>leather recliners facing a glass wall.<br>FIRST PERSON<br>&nbsp;<br>Our reporter tries&nbsp;neurofeedback and learns from computer-animated <br>mice that he has a "busy brain."<br><br>On the other side of the glass Bruno De Michelis, head of the sports <br>science lab for AC Milan, one of the country's top professional teams, <br>monitored a bank of six computer screens wired to a system made by <br>Thought Technology Ltd., a Canadian company. The screens showing how <br>each player's brain responded to stressful situations. Some players, <br>the data showed, were nervous about doing mental exercises in front of <br>their teammates, while others either had trouble winding down after a <br>match or winding up before one. In the following weeks, the players <br>spent hours working on these issues through a series of exercises that <br>resembled computer games, with the brain as the joystick.<br><br>Mr. De Michelis says a tremendous amount of energy in soccer games goes <br>to waste because players lose concentration during key moments, like <br>penalty kicks. "I call this useless suffering," he says. "We can't do <br>magic here, but it can be of some help."<br><br>Having the ability to tune out distractions during competition -- known <br>as having a "quiet mind" -- is one of the holy grails of sports. Jocks <br>believe that the capacity to have extreme concentration during <br>stressful moments gives you a big edge, whether it's a basketball <br>player staying focused on the hoop while thousands of fans are waving <br>their arms in the background, or a tennis player learning not to berate <br>himself for a bad shot.<br><br>To help Tiger Woods learn to block out distractions during critical <br>moments, his late father, Earl, used to jingle change in his pocket, <br>drop golf bags and roll balls across his son's line of vision. Golfer <br>Se Ri Pak's father used a different approach to make her mentally <br>tougher. When she was a child, he took her to pit-bull fights and <br>Korean cemeteries at night.<br><br>Until now, neurofeedback has mostly been confined to medical <br>environments. Sufferers of attention deficit disorder, for example, <br>have been found to have reduced activity in parts of the brain. <br>Neurofeedback teaches them how to produce brainwave patterns that speed <br>up those slow brainwaves. But brain-training has rarely been tried on <br>healthy people, mainly because of doubts about its utility and its high <br>cost, which can be as much as $200 an hour.<br><br>Over the last decade, university researchers and some of the companies <br>that make neurofeedback devices have begun to dabble in the sports <br>world, including helping Olympians like Austrian skier Hermann Maier.<br><br>Many of these same athletes have already had experience with a <br>technique called biofeedback. Biofeedback differs from neurofeedback in <br>that it focuses on controlling physiological responses to stress (like <br>a fast heart rate and extreme muscle tension) as opposed to <br>neurological responses. (To confuse matters, neurofeedback is sometimes <br>referred to as EEG biofeedback.<wbr>)<br><br>Proponents of neurofeedback say retraining your brain, as futuristic as <br>it sounds, is now possible because scientists know precisely which <br>brainwave frequencies correspond with optimal levels of focus. All a <br>person has to do is learn how to achieve those same frequencies by <br>practicing, they say.<br><br>But not all the kinks have been worked out yet, according to some <br>people who have used the neurofeedback devices. Vietta Wilson, who has <br>trained some Canadian track-and-field Olympians, says some of the <br>devices she has tried pick up radio stations instead of brain waves. <br>Another potential problem, according to some researchers: Some of the <br>same devices track brainwaves in a particular part of the brain called <br>the executive center -- but altering brainwaves there can trigger <br>depression in certain people. Several device manufacturers say neither <br>of those problems has been an issue with their products.<br><br>In the last five years, neurofeedback has become the focus of studies <br>in some top medical and psychology journals. In general, they bolster <br>the case that it's possible to retrain the brain.<br><br>Last fall, Canada's governing body of tennis put some of its top 20 <br>youth players through neurofeedback. And McGill University in Montreal <br>and the National Coaching Institute of Montreal have committed to a <br>five-year study to test neurofeedback on the region's top 80 athletes <br>in sports ranging from hockey to racquetball.<br><br>For high-school football player Michael Dell'Aquila, neurofeedback was <br>part of a plan to gain an edge with college scouts. At the time, Mr. <br>Dell'Aquila, a skilled defensive back, had already received letters of <br>interest from dozens of colleges. But he was concerned about his <br>ability to perform in front of recruiters day after day. Specifically, <br>he wanted to learn how to clear his mind of the previous day's <br>performance. So last spring, while he was finishing his junior year at <br>Avon Old Farms prep school in Avon, Conn., he signed up with a nearby <br>practitioner.<br><br>Over the course of about 10 sessions, he worked on boosting his <br>concentration by trying to propel a rocket forward with his mind. If <br>his focus drifted and he either began daydreaming or listening to his <br>inner critic, different-colored rockets associated with those brain <br>states would creep forward and begin to overtake his rocket. The <br>sessions also showed that Mr. Dell'Aquila wasn't getting enough <br>connectivity between the two hemispheres of his brain. So every night <br>during the summer he listened to 30 minutes of specially engineered <br>music. Mr. Dell'Aquila will play football for Boston College beginning <br>this fall. Gio Valiante, a sports psychologist to a number of top <br>golfers including Justin Leonard and Chris DiMarco, says neurofeedback <br>will one day be the norm for PGA Tour pros. But he says he's not about <br>to strap anything onto his clients until these devices are rigorously <br>tested on amateur players.<br> </span><br>
