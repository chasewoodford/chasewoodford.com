<p><span class="page"></span></p><p align="center"><b>Executive Summary – Neurofeedback.</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Imagine wearing a headset and playing a video game that only ‘goes’ 
when you are learning to increase the brain waves associated with focus 
and concentration.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Neurofeedback is a kind of biofeedback which uses a sensor and 
amplifier to detect the brain’s electrical signature so that it can be 
seen, and thereby controlled.&nbsp; By watching your own neural activity
 occurring, and gaining control over the brain waves you are producing, 
you gain greater mental resilience and flexibility. &nbsp;You naturally 
develop better coordinated neural activity.&nbsp; Multiple and diverse 
benefits are typical, without any unwanted effects.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The educational benefits apply to all students including athletes, 
gifted students and those with myriad special needs.&nbsp; Neurofeedback
 yields permanent improvements in attention, learning, and memory.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;It is used by the U.S. military, business, athletes and 
performers to consistently achieve top performance, summon profound 
concentration, and apply greater mental power to solve complex 
problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are <b>several hundred </b>scientific studies showing complete 
and permanent elimination of ADHD, learning problems, and numerous 
neurological disorders which cripple learning.&nbsp; The process is 
beneficial for everyone to improve focus and concentration. &nbsp;Over 
the past 30 years neurofeedback has proven completely safe in all 
cases.&nbsp; </p>
<p>IQ boosts of 10-20 points are typical in certain special needs 
groups.&nbsp; No other training or intervention of any kind has so 
substantially reduced students’ need for pharmaceuticals such as 
Ritalin.&nbsp; No other technology is as promising to reduce the cost of
 providing a higher quality education to all students. No remedial or 
didactic program has such compelling supportive data to fulfill the 
President’s vision of leaving no student behind. </p>
<p>Several impressive organizations have embraced this technology due 
it’s extraordinary results.&nbsp; But because the underlying paradigm in
 new, institutional acceptance and definitive research funding has been 
slow.&nbsp; The worst that can be said is that more research is 
warranted.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to get out in front early of this wide open 
trend thundering at you soon.&nbsp; This may be the first you’ve heard 
of neurofeedback, but it will not be the last.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A simple investigation on Google using terms such as ‘Neurofeedback, 
QEEG, Lubar, ADHD, or ‘peak performance’ will be very revealing and 
convincing of claims made here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>The Broad Range of Benefits to Students from Neurofeedback</b></p>
<p><b>Neural Awareness for Mental Self-Regulation. </b><b></b></p>
<p>Biofeedback is learning.&nbsp; Use a special mirror for awareness of a
 function, and control of that function ensues.&nbsp; It works on the 
principle that if you can clearly see or hear continuous real-time 
output of a bodily function such as muscle tension, temperature, or 
blood pressure, then you can learn to manipulate it.&nbsp; Neurofeedback
 is biofeedback that uses an EEG to display the weak electrical 
by-product which all live brains emanate.&nbsp; Some sensors on the 
scalp can read blood flood in the brain instead of the electrical 
echo.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thus, neurofeedback is simply mental activity awareness 
training.&nbsp; With awareness comes the ability to control brainwave 
output and opens the possibility for self-regulation.&nbsp; Real time 
observation of brainwaves leads to improved control for greater 
resilience and flexibility of well coordinated neural activity.&nbsp; It
 can look and feel just like playing a videogame with your mind while 
wearing a special headset.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Neurofeedback has consistently been shown safe and effective in 
improving self-regulation of neural activity in children of all 
ages.&nbsp; The benefits are numerous, diverse and profound.&nbsp; The 
myriad benefits are obtained by all kinds of students.</p>
<p>Of special note, on the one hand, are student athletes and gifted 
students.&nbsp; The US Army academy and U.S. Olympic program have 
embraced neurofeedback to optimize peak performance at 
will.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also ample evidence of substantial benefits for those with 
attention, behavioral, and learning deficits.&nbsp; There is definitive 
scientific evidence of partial or complete remediation of problems for 
those with ADHD, learning disorders and myriad neurologically-based 
disorders.&nbsp; To examine this evidence, simply open a search engine 
such as Google and enter the terms “Neurofeedback” or “QEEG” and any 
other term of interest.&nbsp; QEEG stands for Quantitative 
ElectroEncephaloGraph which is a data intensive brain map used for 
diagnosis.&nbsp; Caution: There are over 500 high quality scientific 
journal articles on neurofeedback or EEG biofeedback.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nearly all students can derive either intellectual, social, 
emotional, or physiological benefits from optimizing neural functioning 
through this kind of biofeedback training with an EEG or HEG. </p>
<p>Neurofeedback is safe enough to be approved by the FDA for consumers’
 unregulated use.&nbsp; There is no risk in this form of learning.&nbsp;
 But choices do have to be made, so the training might be supervised by 
certified professionals, but run day-to-day by teachers’ aids.&nbsp; In 
competent hands, it is reasonable to expect that 60-90% of all students,
 will experience permanent educational benefits ranging from subtle to 
exceptional.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The most likely benefits are enduring increases in the ability to 
concentrate, focus, learn, remember, and make complex decisions.&nbsp; 
Many other benefits are commonly reported.&nbsp; For example, IQ 
increases of 10-20 points are common in certain special needs 
groups.&nbsp; This result is considered by some to be a combination of 
remediation of a certain reading or attentional difficulty plus 
generalized improvement in brain functioning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Quickly Self-Funding, and then Cost Saving. </b></p>
<p>Special education students make disproportionate use of costly 
resources.&nbsp; The cost of implementing a neurofeedback program is not
 only small, but it is self-funding.&nbsp; The money to pay for the EEG 
equipment, software, and trainers are recouped in the cost savings of 
mainstreaming special education students.&nbsp; This effect will be 
apparent, even obvious, in any group of students, within a few months of
 training in school.&nbsp; Even a pilot program should yield net cost 
savings within one year.&nbsp; </p>
<p>No other kind of method has so substantially reduced students' need for </p>
<p>pharmaceuticals such as Ritalin.&nbsp; No other technology is as 
promising to enlarge the academic prospects of children with learning 
handicaps.&nbsp; There is no alternative program, remedial product, or 
didactic curriculum which can make claims this credible and promising to
 fulfill the President's vision to leave no child behind.</p>
<p><b>The State of the Art is Continuing to Develop.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>Neurofeedback is not a new technology.&nbsp; It is not a popular technology.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Longitudinal studies for ADHD are now older than the term ADHD (20 
years).&nbsp; The results often show that 90% of students experience 
complete and permanent relief of attentional symptoms.&nbsp; Enter 
“Lubar ADHD” in Google.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few theories about how and why it works.&nbsp; But our 
brains may not be complex enough to understand the complexity of our 
brains.&nbsp; Compelling to many are the before and after brain maps 
done with QEEG, SPECT, LORETTA, and other brain imaging 
techniques.&nbsp; The math and physics are esoteric, but the before and 
after pictures are obviously more balanced, healthy, and robust.&nbsp; 
My opinion is that the body will choose health and reject dysfunction 
when shown how.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thousands of practitioners all over this nation are performing 
miracles (according to the Moms) in just 40 sessions.&nbsp; The field is
 specialized and developing rapidly.&nbsp; Experts are not of one mind 
on several topics.&nbsp; Advanced and skillful practioners prefer 
certain equipment, theories and nuances to approaching neurofeedback 
treatment. &nbsp;There is a lively debate about optimizing training 
methods.&nbsp; Some seek to reduce the number of sessions while others 
seek to derive all possible benefits.&nbsp; Several hardware vendors and
 software technologies claim similar results.</p>
<p>There may not be one ‘best’ approach now.&nbsp; There are not enough 
well-funded research studies to have settled all these issues.&nbsp; But
 <b>any of these issues are all minor points </b>when compared with the 
big picture: massive educational benefits and savings await the 
willing.&nbsp; Courage and leadership will be rewarded. &nbsp;This is an
 international opportunity for excellence. </p>
<p><b>How Much Neurofeedback Should We Start … and How Soon? </b></p>
<p>There are three primary issues when considering adoption of any 
neurofeedback proposal.&nbsp; Safety, effectiveness, and the evaluation 
process.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Safe.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>When conducted by volunteers or professionals, there is no credible 
problem with safety.&nbsp; Even in a partially self-insuring district 
with a litigious population, risk is not an issue.&nbsp; The only real 
potential litigation problem is NOT adopting neurofeedback in a timely 
manner, or in rejecting it unfairly.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Effective.</b></p>
<p>Hundreds of studies and thousands of testimonials say this is no 
placebo effect.&nbsp; Despite the evidence of effectiveness, there are 
not plenty of neurofeedback programs in schools in surrounding 
districts.&nbsp; The worst that can be said is that neurofeedback is 
experimental.&nbsp; There are only 500 peer reviewed journal articles 
with results that range from mild to extraordinary.&nbsp; The big, 
definitive multi-university, randomized, replicated, double-blind, 
prospective, controlled scientific study has not yet been funded.&nbsp; 
We could be a major factor in the coming revolution.&nbsp; This is a 
highly significant opportunity in all respects.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Evaluation.</b></p>
<p>The only expert competent to judge neurofeedback is one familiar with
 the specific technologies. &nbsp;This kind of proposal has been 
defeated in other districts because of uniformed and erroneous criticism
 by experts without expertise.&nbsp; In other districts, it has 
languished because decision makers had no clear criteria to evaluate 
degree of effectiveness required for adoption.&nbsp; When a proposal is 
new or strange, it is subjected to extraordinary levels of fit and proof
 which apply to no other decision.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In still other districts, those who saw a proposal die, do not say 
why.&nbsp; Therefore, an open process of evaluation by those qualified 
in the science and practice of neurofeedback is essential.&nbsp; 
Reasonable criteria for adoption should be recognized early and then 
honored in the light of day.&nbsp; The results of fair pilot studies 
should determine the degree of subsequent steps toward greater use of 
neurofeedback in the School District. &nbsp;The risk is nil, the upside 
extraordinary in many ways.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Adopting neurofeedback to any degree requires courage, vision, and 
openness to good ideas which aren’t entirely understood. &nbsp;The 
potential rewards are awesome.&nbsp; The risk of inaction is merely 
unfortunate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Conclusion:</b></p>
<p>Self-controlled brain wave training has benefits to offer special 
education students, athletes, gifted students, and all students.&nbsp; 
There is substantial scientific evidence of complete remediation for 
those with attention deficits and myriad learning disorders.&nbsp; The 
largest benefit is for normal students in the form or greater ability to
 focus on learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is believed that all students can derive either intellectual, 
social, emotional, or physiological benefits from optimizing neural 
functioning.&nbsp; There is no risk of harm or downside to this form of 
learning.&nbsp; In 80-90% of all students, permanent health and 
educational benefits range from subtle to profound.&nbsp; Most often 
cited are enduring increases in abilities to concentrate, focus, learn, 
remember, and make complex decisions.&nbsp; Other benefits such as 
improvements in sleep are commonly reported.&nbsp; IQ increases of 10-20
 points are typical in certain special needs groups.&nbsp; Apart from 
relieving a deficiency, nothing else increases IQ by 10-20 points.&nbsp;
 </p>
<p>No other educational program, therapy, or treatment has proven claims
 to reduce or totally eliminate ADHD students’ need for pharmaceutical 
stimulants such as Ritalin.&nbsp; No other technology is as promising to
 reduce the cost of providing a higher quality education to all 
students. &nbsp;No remedial or didactic program has proven this 
effective in fulfilling the President’s vision of leaving no student 
behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beware of expert provincialism, defensiveness, unwarranted caution, 
and unrevealed economic motives for squelching enlightened forward 
movement.&nbsp; For example, psychiatry has well funded studies proving 
drugs are a temporary remedy for ADHD. &nbsp;The drugs don’t work for 
everyone and there are significant deleterious effects to powerful 
stimulants.&nbsp; Therapy based on interaction with child psychologists 
lack the kind of scientific verification for safety or effectiveness 
enjoyed by neurofeedback.&nbsp; They are naturally in conflict with a 
technology that can end their usefulness. &nbsp;There are no outspoken 
critics of neurofeedback who don’t have conflicts of interest, such as 
livelihood or having received pharmaceutical funding.&nbsp; The entire 
field of ADHD treatment is due for a paradigm shift.&nbsp; </p>
