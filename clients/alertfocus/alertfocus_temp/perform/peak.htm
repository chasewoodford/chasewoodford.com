<p><span class="page"></span></p><p><em>by John Putman, M.A., M.S., MFT </em></p>
<p>Although many world class athletes say that athletic performance is 
predominately mental, the vast majority of athletic programs at our 
colleges and schools do not emphasis any sort of mental fitness 
training. We have all heard performers describe states of peak athletic 
prowess in such terms as “being in the flow” or “time having slowed 
down”. Fran Tarkenton, the former quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings,
 used to describe how everyone would appear to “move in slow motion” 
when he would drop back to throw a pass –as if he had all the time in 
the world. These descriptions of peak performance clearly reflect states
 that are within the mental domain. </p>
<p>The Martial Arts have always recognized the connection between the 
psyche and the physical. As such, practitioners and teachers of the 
martial arts place great emphasis on strengthening this relationship as a
 critical part of their training. Physical agility, accuracy and 
endurance are predicated on discipline and focus. Top athletes strive 
for an “energetically economic” (or ‘ergonomic’) performance through the
 maximizing of a sense of “oneness” with the body. Achieving such 
oneness involves mastery over the nervous system through the development
 and refining of inner awareness. Although exercises such as meditation 
can certainly take a person part of the way there, modern technology 
allows for the development of a much more panoramic inner awareness 
through something called biofeedback.</p>
<p>Biofeedback can be thought of as a window on the inner workings of 
brain and body which serves to complete the mental to physical awareness
 loop. Biofeedback essentially involves the measurement of a certain 
aspect of physiological functioning which is ordinarily beyond the 
person’s awareness, and then mapping it into a video display for easy 
observation. In bringing the unobserved into the realm of the observed, a
 person is able to alter physiological functioning. Peak performance 
training involves altering brainwave activity, or the EEG 
(electroencephalogram). Research has shown that altering the brainwave 
activity can have very beneficial effects on a person’s ability to focus
 and maintain attention. In addition EEG biofeedback can improve mood 
disorders, such as anxiety and depression, as well as sleep –all of 
which can affect the quality of athletic performance. Although a certain
 amount of arousal is necessary to perform optimally, every athlete, 
singer or dancer knows that anxiety can cripple any performance. In 
order to understand this more fully, one has to realize that anxiety is a
 survival trait that evolved into existence because it was conducive to 
the preservation of the human species. Anxiety serves as the first line 
of defense against threats to survival. It is, essentially, the sentry 
for the “fight or flight” system -- in that it is fear that drives an 
organism (human or otherwise) to either fight or flee. Anxiety compels 
us to anticipate the immediate future. However, that which has served so
 well in protecting and preserving the human species, can become a major
 liability in the arena of performance or competition. This is because a
 performer has to be totally present “in the moment”. Anxious persons 
are forever anticipating the NEXT moment and, consequently, lose their 
connection with the present. The results can be catastrophic …or at the 
very least embarrassing. “Choking”, “crashing” or “forgetting one’s 
lines” are all examples of the lack of focus that can result from 
runaway anxiety. </p>
<p>EEG biofeedback is not a new technique. It has been used for nearly 
40 years. Clinical use of brainwave training began in the late sixties 
after research psychologist M. Barry Sterman of UCLA found that operant 
conditioning of the EEG activity was very effective in resolving seizure
 disorders. Over the past several years EEG training has found 
application in treating an ever widening array of problems and 
disorders. One of the most well researched applications of EEG 
biofeedback is for the remediation of attention deficits (Attention 
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, ADHD), related behavioral disorders, and
 specific learning disabilities.</p>
<p>EEG biofeedback’s primary purpose in peak performance is to reduce 
anxiety; increase attention and focus; normalize arousal levels; reduce 
misdirected muscular energy expenditure; and improve the body’s normal 
circadian cycles –particularly with regard to sleep. In addition to the 
physiological normalization, there are psychological benefits as well. 
Anyone who has ever studied stress management knows about the powerfully
 counterproductive effect of something called “negative self talk”. 
Persons with self esteem issues tend to lacerate themselves whenever 
they make a mistake. “Perfectionists” tend to punish themselves in this 
way and in doing so, virtually eliminate any chance of even approaching 
perfection. Nothing destroys focus and guarantees failure more 
effectively than beating yourself up in mid-performance. In our 
experience, EEG biofeedback has been shown to boost a person’s sense of 
self worth due, in part, to the gaining of mastery over one’s own 
central nervous system. In addition, an individual learns how to hold a 
narrow focus and at the same time maintain a widened awareness –a 
necessary precondition for the peak experience.</p>
<p>High achievers in any field are often described as having an inner 
bearing characterized by confidence, calm and an ability to focus under 
pressure. Such qualities have physiological manifestations that can be 
trained and refined. Thus, in order for athletes to maximize their 
potential, a training regimen must include exercises that improve the 
brain’s regulatory efficiency. EEG biofeedback offers such an exercise.</p> <br>
