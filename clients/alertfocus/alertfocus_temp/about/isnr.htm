<p><span class="page"></span></p><p><strong>This is a personal blog of 
my experience at the ISNR conference in San Antonio the last week in 
August, 2008.&nbsp; The comments are dense, choppy snippets freely 
intermingling what I heard and thought.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong>Tuesday </strong>night:&nbsp; Past, Present and Future of NF from our luminaries. </p>
<p>Tom Budzinski is an amazing raconteur spinning neurofeedback and 
neuromodulation stories going back to 1966 and speculations on into the 
future.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Joel Lubar thinks Z-score training is big.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Barry Sterman is lucid and entertaining even with too much to 
drink.&nbsp; He describes our early meetings as being composed of the 
scientific researcher types versus the levitators, who wear robes.&nbsp;
 </p>
<p>At a meeting in 1969 the members are divided: shall we call it 
autoregulation or biofeedback?&nbsp; Some wing nut says the Teamsters 
may not like autoregulation.&nbsp; So biofeedback it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday. </strong>Vince Monastra’s all day workshop on treating ADHD. </p>
<p>Demoralization is a common comorbitity.&nbsp; Treat attention first, 
then other issues may resolve, if not treat them.&nbsp; (This is 
different than the paradigm of treating arousal first, then attention 
then memory systems).&nbsp; </p>
<p>Get your 20 grams of protein in the morning or else.&nbsp; Bipolar 
meds take 20 points off IQ.&nbsp; His office has a Lego pit.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Vince sees extreme theta/beta ratios under task of 8:1 vs. 3:1 in 
normals.&nbsp; He trains to that criteria.&nbsp; But don’t expect 
significant change before 20 sessions.&nbsp; More on this ratio later.</p>
<p>Vince does an extremely thorough intake insisting on all kinds of 
records and tests.&nbsp; But not always a QEEG.&nbsp; After a couple of 
visits he says, no we are not going to do neurofeedback now.&nbsp; Come 
back and see me in a month.&nbsp;&nbsp; I object: it is often obvious 
when interviewing an ADHD family that we have a genetically inherited 
neurological disorder and those genes belong to you-know-who. &nbsp;No, 
you must do the history to avoid having a 65% success rate.&nbsp; There 
are many things that mimic ADHD.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Vince also has a well regarded parenting book.&nbsp; One theme:&nbsp; You mess up, then make amends. </p>
<p>I had a nice conversation with the Myers’ of Boston Biofeedback, 
regular ISNR attendees.&nbsp; Some people find freebie newspapers to be a
 better advertising source than the regional glossy mags.&nbsp; Others 
say the opposite.&nbsp; I encourage a few people to check out Google ad 
words to begin pay per click internet advertising to drive local people 
to your web site.&nbsp; “A no brainer.”&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Thursday </strong>morning.&nbsp; <br>The student award paper 
is about enhancing eye microsurgeon skills.&nbsp; SMR training which is 
better than Alpha/theta training.&nbsp; Results: surgeries 25% faster 
and r = .7 better.&nbsp;&nbsp; Best done 2x week.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Russell Barkley says QEEG is most sensitive diagnostic tool for ADHD.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Jay Gunkleman on predicting medication response to stimulants.&nbsp; 
Phenotypes are not subtypes?&nbsp; Beware of your database seeing slow 
alpha as theta.</p>
<p>Dirk DeRidder shows us brains of reptiles and other mammals.&nbsp; 
The sea squirt has a nervous system until it finds a home rock.&nbsp; 
Then it eats it brain.&nbsp; No TV involved.&nbsp; To treat tinnitus 
train delta down and alpha up at CZ.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Barry Sterman tells some of the cat story.&nbsp; Look for an NF 
article in the journal Sleep this year.&nbsp; SMR training reduces sleep
 latency and improves memory without increasing resting SMR.&nbsp; I 
wonder if there are “network effects”?&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the hall, Marvin Sams likes HRV for eating disorders.&nbsp; He 
wishes he could do the Mirasol eating disorder study again because he 
would be able to beat his already astonishing results.&nbsp; See 
AlertFocus.com for summaries. </p>
<p>Walter Freeman, a grand old man, gave a talk on integrating chemical 
(MRI, SPECT), EEG and MEG brain imaging.&nbsp; Let’s live Z-score to 
your phenotype with that!&nbsp; “That was the best presentation I’ve 
heard since I was at MIT.”&nbsp; It was at least one SD over my 
head.&nbsp; There are 13.7 billion neurons in each 
hemisphere.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Tom Brod.&nbsp; Thanks for offering to email us your 
presentation.&nbsp; Non linear means a small change can require a large 
accommodation.&nbsp; LENS sends one trillionth the exposure of a cell 
phone.&nbsp; (Later I heard others dispute this.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Beverly 
Rubik says: in biofields cells whisper and listen to each other.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Give the brain a mirror and it is fascinated.&nbsp; It wallows in 
information about itself; it becomes absorbed in self-interaction.&nbsp;
 </p>
<p>Small group on alcoholism.&nbsp; High beta at CZ is related to 
relapse.&nbsp; Some practitioners do only a little alpha-theta training 
near end of treatment.&nbsp; I wonder if slow alpha at PZ is a marker or
 a predictor of alcoholism?&nbsp; The 75% success rate holds at 7-10 
year follow up.&nbsp; Drop out rates are high even at in-patient 
facilities, but SMR training helps that.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>“The only active ingredient in NF is your intention, Ed Hamlin.”&nbsp; </p>
<p>Workshop by Elliott and Edmonson on HRV as The Respiratory Arterial Pressure Wave.&nbsp; See <a href="http://www.coherence.com/">www.Coherence.com</a>.&nbsp; <br>If
 you cut the vegus nerve HR goes to 90 with no HRV.&nbsp; I bemoan that 
there is no hardware or software protocol to find your optimal breathing
 rate.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Steven believes everybody’s optimal breathing frequency is 5 breaths 
per minute.&nbsp; Even in and out.&nbsp; HRV correlates well with skin 
conductance and alpha waves. Self-governance.&nbsp; Relaxation 
bridges:&nbsp; eyes, jaw, tongue,&nbsp; throat, breathing, hands, 
urinary, anal, feet. &nbsp;Nobody has hypertension and at least a 13 
beat swing in their HRV.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Eat a balanced diet, take adequate rest, get moderate exercise and do RSA breathing 2 times a day for 10 minutes.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Migraine Panel<br></strong>Frank Andraisik shows the diverse 
and compelling research case for biofeedback.&nbsp; If the medical, 
scientific, insurance and government establishment doesn’t accept all 
that research then Kuhn’s revolution is not being televised.&nbsp; BF is
 as good as meds, but don’t degrade and results last.&nbsp; We get 50% 
(30-60%) success rates with BF.&nbsp; For NF 70-90%.&nbsp; </p>
<p>What kind of headache is that?&nbsp; There are lumpers and splitters.&nbsp; <br>Medication rebound is now called medication overuse.&nbsp; <br>Hand cooling is almost as useful as hand warming. <br>Siegfried is training at .001 Hz: yes, that is a 100 second brainwave.&nbsp; <br>Finding
 the right reward frequency is vital, but once you’ve got the sweet spot
 it will cure what ails you.&nbsp; Sue used to start high and move down;
 now she starts low and moves up to better avoid adverse 
reactions.&nbsp; <br>Jeff Carmen starts with 10 min of pIR HEG.&nbsp; BF sessions are 20 minutes.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Nice results on Q with just one session on the Stress Eraser for anxiety. </p>
<p>Progress of Neurofeedback<br>Tanya gives a talk urging us to develop 
standard methods for disorders moving in the direction of a standard of 
care.&nbsp; We must do more and better research so that we can be 
accepted by the scientific and medical communities.&nbsp; My ire 
builds.&nbsp; Incensed, I rush to mike and say no.&nbsp; This is no time
 to reign in our methods to standards of validated protocols.&nbsp; Few,
 if anyone, in the room only does the theta/beta ratio training used in 
our best published studies for ADHD.&nbsp; We are flourishing with 
innovation and artistry; this must be encouraged.&nbsp; </p>
<p>ISNR is a BCIA club and a QEEG&nbsp; club (despite the utter lack of 
published studies supporting that either of these are a good 
idea).&nbsp; ISNR is too a small tent.&nbsp; Where are all the other 
kinds of practitioners?&nbsp; Those who use systems by Val, Van Deusen 
and Othmer.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>And even more research as a path to acceptance?&nbsp; If publishing 
research worked then biofeedback would be accepted for our strongest 
indications such as migraine.&nbsp; if only If data would convince 
biofeedback would be covered by insurance and there would be thriving 
practices based on referrals.&nbsp; There used to be hundreds of people 
in my Pennsylvania Biofeedback Society, now just a couple of 
dozen.&nbsp; If research worked then CES (Cranial Electrical 
Stimulation) would not have over 100 secret articles plus the 2 dozen 
unknown animal studies.&nbsp; Why is biofeedback being dropped from 
textbooks and curricula?&nbsp;&nbsp; While my rant was not booed, 
opposing comments were applauded.&nbsp; I appreciated those who consoled
 me that I do have a point. (And that it sits atop my pointy 
head).&nbsp; </p>
<p>Eran Zaidel wonders why theta-beta ratio training doesn’t change that
 value.&nbsp; There must be a network effects on a meta control 
system.&nbsp; But Vince Monastra does see that value change.&nbsp; Is 
this a difference due to measuring under task?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Mario Beauregard presents an elegant research design on 
depression.&nbsp; Only heart disease is more of a burden to society than
 major depression.&nbsp; 5-15% suicide.&nbsp; He induces sadness with 
movies to study the decreased cerebral blood flow.&nbsp; Not theta or 
alpha, only beta is abnormal.&nbsp; NF is done with Clockwork Orange 
challenge: “You boss is concerned about the quality of your work.”&nbsp;
 Now figure out how to keep the brainwave bar high.&nbsp; And they do, 
with meta cognitions and other counter toxic thought strategies that 
Albert Ellis would endorse. &nbsp;I realize that my neurofeedback is all
 done with movies which may have some of this same effect. </p>
<p>NF has 74% success rate (no longer meet criteria for MD).&nbsp; I 
asked about the 26% failures. Non-responders are the 
non-believers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Cory Hammond on depression.&nbsp; Cory blasts the big pharma bias in 
studies.&nbsp; Keep researching until you get a good study to 
publish.&nbsp; Results evaporate with non active placebo.&nbsp; Bob 
Gurnee sees 12 sub-types of depression.&nbsp; Bipolar is tougher to 
treat especially if rapid cycling.&nbsp; You have treat the client-state
 that shows up that day.&nbsp; Anxiety can be located anywhere.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Bob Gurnee tells me that if you train the brain to certain value it 
stays there for good or ill.&nbsp; You can’t rely up the wisdom of the 
body to self-correct and select only best states, as I have heard others
 assume.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I’m noticing rampant confusion among the presenters due to the issues of phenotype, sub-group, and measurement conditions.</p>
<p>Over lunch a man told me he was looking for a person to do some 
work.&nbsp; I knew exactly the right guy and made the 
introductions.&nbsp; As a long time career consultant I would like to 
have my fingerprints on a good career move. </p>
<p>In the hall I see Jonathan Walker pressing down on some guys arm. 
&nbsp;I always thought muscle testing was hokum I say, but no he assures
 me, it works great.&nbsp; Okay, so I’ve got a toothache and my dentist 
says I need a root canal, but I’m not exactly sure which tooth it 
is.&nbsp; Can you check?&nbsp; So I put my arm out and he mutters some 
options.&nbsp; The decision tree takes surprising turns.&nbsp; He 
divines that I have an infection.&nbsp; Further that I need 400 mg of 
amoxicillin 4xd for 6 days.&nbsp; He even calls the script into a local 
pharmacy!&nbsp; That night I have a confidential treatment that takes 
the pain away for the rest of the conference.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong></p>
<p>Nick Dogris reports amazing results for LENS on ADHD.<br>Very few don’t respond in 15 sessions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Jonathan Walker does a difference map between EO and task.&nbsp; He 
finds that poor readers deactivate critical areas of the brain under 
task. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As I wander the vendor area I try Jon Cowan’s Pleasurizer.&nbsp; This
 device has wonderful face validity for the mind-brain connection.&nbsp;
 You can see your focus bar go up and down as your fades in and 
out.&nbsp; A clear mirror.&nbsp; Jon induced some of my pleasant 
memories and my blue graph rose as my heart swelled with joy.&nbsp; What
 a high!&nbsp; </p>
<p>I tell Tom Brownback with his really very highly systemized approach, that I have anus envy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am slowly tilting, yawing and rolling on a table with pRoshi 
glasses and relaxation coming through the headphones.&nbsp; I overhear 
that a woman has a blinding migraine and she has to get to a conference 
PDQ.&nbsp; She was brought over from Toomin’s booth.&nbsp; I quickly get
 up and help her on the table and gently massage her feet.&nbsp; Next 
day I discover she is a psychiatrist and that the migraine was 
completely aborted in 15 minutes and she slept like a log that 
night.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The stock brokerage firm E.F. Hutton had a TV commercial where 2 
people are having a conversion in a crowed restaurant.&nbsp; One says, 
my broker is E.F. Hutton and E.F.Hutton says … At which point the place 
goes silent.&nbsp; Neurofeedback is the opposite.&nbsp; As soon as you 
say neurofeedback, everybody stops listening.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Joel Lubar finds that theta/beta ratio is strongest in youth, but not
 in adults where more than 5.5 alpha/beta ratio is a better marker at PZ
 EC.&nbsp;&nbsp; He doesn’t like autothresholding; instead set a goal, 
now try to beat it.&nbsp; Joel imparts lots of practical wisdom, even 
when standing still.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Advanced Z-score training, Tom Collura.</p>
<p>Everybody is raving about live Z-score training.&nbsp; I find it a 
pleasure to watch the amplitudes resolve then the coherences in just a 
few sessions.&nbsp; EO an EC resolve together without specific 
attention.&nbsp; Beware of training down several peak performance 
patterns without clinical complaints. Beware of dismantling 
coping/compensating patterns too soon such as cognitive dissonance in 
PTSD. </p>
<p>Why don’t I see aberrant theta/beta ratios in my ADHD kids?&nbsp; 
Because resting theta/beta is not that big of marker.&nbsp; ADHD is a 
frontal lobe dysfunction.&nbsp; I can’t wait to see if this jumps up 
under task.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I hear the PR committee is meeting.&nbsp; I propose the question: 
Shall we devote our efforts at courting philanthropists or buying 
lobbyists.&nbsp; They decide to make a brochure.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Saturday night dinner.&nbsp; <br>During the open comment period I 
regret not saying that in the fund raising community it is called 
planned giving.&nbsp; I have put ISNR in my last will and testament and 
urge others to do the same.</p>
<p>Martijn Arns suggests we add the word Neuromodulation to the name of 
the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research.&nbsp; He wants
 to include rTMS and direct current stimulation.&nbsp; At my table we 
ponder the name: International Society of middle aged psychologists who 
do Qs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Michael Thompson points out that the ISNR logo has a cardio wave.&nbsp; I notice that it flat lines.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There is a ground swell for Leslie Sherlin to be the permanent 
conference chair and get paid for it, but he cuts off the question. </p>
<p>Late into Saturday night there is an ample supply of good looking, 
high spirited women who like to dance.&nbsp; It was not always so.&nbsp;
 Among Leslie Sherlin’s talents is the ability to boogey on down.&nbsp; 
Next day I ask Leslie “Don’t you have any enemies?”&nbsp; He assures me 
he does, but I think he is just being agreeable. </p>
<p>I will consider advertising for cases that are expected to take a 
long time such as bi-polar, depression, OCD, ADHD and autism.&nbsp; 
Anxiety and insomnia clear up too quickly for both bread and 
butter.&nbsp; Those with migraine don't present themselves for 
treatment.&nbsp; </p>
<p>My most fascinating conversation was with Jim Kowal.&nbsp; He looks 
like Alan Alda and projects that same depth of humanity.&nbsp; He 
described his work with EMDR and hypnosis with trauma and multiple 
personality disorder.&nbsp; I got strategy to try with my refractory 
bulimic.&nbsp;&nbsp; Elicit a ‘day in the life’ grade school 
autobiography starting with kindergarten.&nbsp; I’m looking for a year 
she can’t remember.&nbsp; I’m expecting she will lose details about 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> grade.&nbsp; Nice try, but it doesn’t work on her.&nbsp; </p>
<p>“Stress is like breathing carbon monoxide.&nbsp; You don’t know your are breathing it until it kills you.” </p>
<p>Jim said the EMDR conference really has it together.&nbsp; How do you
 record in and out times for CEUs when 700 people are gathered for a key
 note address?&nbsp; The UPC codes on your name tag are swiped at the 
door.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Everybody agreed that this ISNR meeting was a big winner.&nbsp; Yes 
the European meetings are more scientific, this one better for 
practitioners.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>
<p>Ron Swatzyna is predicting medication response and monitoring toxicity.&nbsp; </p>
<p>At least CNS Response and BRC are working on pharmacology and EEG and
 wonder if they use the same markers and give the same advice.&nbsp; I 
wonder the same about our several eminent Q readers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Give coke heads SMR up and theta down with motivational interviewing.&nbsp; Now you tell me, too late for George Bush.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Everybody was talking about amplitude and coherences.&nbsp; I did not
 hear variability mentioned nor the EO-EC transition. I miss Val Brown 
and wish he were welcome.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Juri Kropotov finds ERP to the best discriminator of ADHD and he finds two types.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Jay Gunkleman is one of the masters at creating EEG and Q-guided NF 
treatment plans.&nbsp; He reads genotype and phenotype 
distinctions.&nbsp; He gets 20 point IQ jumps in addicts. </p>
<p>I’m off to the airport, but the fun continues.&nbsp; I have a nice 
conversation with Dirk DeRidder in Brookstone.&nbsp; He thinks we need a
 good explanation of NF with mechanism of action before medical schools 
will embrace us.&nbsp; I have a pleasant lunch with Jeff Carmen and 
Glenn Weiner before boarding my plane.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am so high and excited to have had such sustained exhilaration for 
the entire conference.&nbsp; The intellectual stimulation was rich and 
the fellowship sublime.&nbsp; I fully expect the ramifications of this 
experience to transform my private practice.&nbsp; </p>
