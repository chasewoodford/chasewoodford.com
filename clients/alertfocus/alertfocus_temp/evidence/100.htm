<p><b><em>ABSTRACT. </em></b></p>
<p><b><i>Background</i></b><i>.</i> 100 migraine sufferers were treated 
using Passive Infrared Hemoencephalography (pIR HEG) over a period of 
four years. All subjects met the criteria for at least one of the 
categories set forth in the International Headache Society (IHS) 
classification criteria for headache disorders (IHS, 1988) for primary 
migraine.</p>
<p><b><i>Methods</i></b>. Subjects were treated using the pIR HEG system
 in 30 minute sessions. A central forehead placement (approximately Fpz)
 was used for the sensor assembly for all subjects. Changes in headache 
patterns were examined. In addition, after two years, an infrared video 
imaging system was added to the data collection process. This was 
available for 61of the 100 subjects. Infrared forehead images were 
captured at the start and end of each session to examine changes in 
prefrontal cortical brain activity.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b><i>Results</i></b>. Most of the subjects improved control over 
their migraine headaches. Over 90% of those subjects who completed at 
least 6 sessions, reported significant improvements in migraine 
activity.</p>
<p><b><i>Conclusions</i></b><i>.</i> pIR HEG appears to have a strong 
impact on migraine headaches, even for people who have not had a 
positive response to medication. Headache response by the end of 6 
sessions appears to be a good predictor of probability of improvement.</p>

<p align="center">BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Introduction to pIR HEG.</p>
<p>The term Hemoencephalography was first used by Hershel Toomim in 1997
 (Toomim, 2002) to describe his process of Near Infrared 
Spectrophotometry (NIRS HEG) system. The Passive Infrared 
Hemoencephalography (pIR HEG) system evolved from Carmen’s application 
of infrared technology to peripheral thermal biofeedback (Carmen, 2002).
 The evolution was in part, based on the psychophysiological concepts 
developed by Toomim (Toomim &amp; Carmen, 1999) with his NIRS HEG 
system. </p>
<p>Both systems (pIR HEG and NIRS HEG) respond to blood flow dynamics as
 a source of data. They also share a total freedom from eye roll and 
surface EMG artifacts. This makes both systems well suited for 
exercising brain activity in the prefrontal cortex, without any concern 
for the effects of these artifacts on the integrity of the acquired 
signal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The pIR HEG system was specifically developed as a potential 
intervention technique for migraine headaches. As such, most of the 
developing data regarding efficacy relates to migraine headaches. The 
conceptualization for training cerebrovascular control to produce 
migraine control was based on the tentative assumption that if a person 
could learn to control cerebrovascular activity, especially control over
 excessive vasodilation, control over migraine activity would follow. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, training a person to directly constrict excessively 
dilated cerebrovascular structures did not work, regardless of whether a
 person had a migraine headache at the time or not. Most people could 
easily learn to increase the pIR HEG signal, but few could reduce it at 
all. </p>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing excessive vasodilation in the 
cerebrovascular system would reduce migraine pain was based on the 
vascular theory of migraine pathophysiology that was popular at that 
time (Diamond, 1994). Migraine researchers have since rejected that 
theory in favor of a more comprehensive theory of migraine 
pathophysiology involving the trigeminal nerve and its interactions with
 the brainstem and cerebrovascular system (Goadsby, 2001). This may be 
an interesting example of an intervention process that failed to work as
 anticipated because it was conceptually based on a theory that was 
later invalidated.</p>
<p>Based on Toomim’s pioneering application of NIRS HEG to the 
prefrontal cortex (Toomim &amp; Carmen, 1999) to increase brain 
activity, the pIR HEG process was modified to train increases instead of
 decreases. This turned out to be a very good idea. When the pIR HEG 
sensor assembly was placed at Fpz, and the training process was directed
 towards increasing prefrontal cortical brain activity, the effects were
 direct and positive on both migraine prophylaxis and actual abortion of
 migraine headaches. This effect on migraine activity may have more to 
do with training control over the inhibitory effects of the prefrontal 
cortex than training direct vascular control. The effects are also more 
consistent with current thinking regarding the pathophysiology of 
migraine (Goadsby, 2001).</p>
<p>The nature of migraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The true nature of migraine headaches remains elusive. Migraines 
represent a complex paroxysmal neurovascular phenomenon. They occur in 
two major stages, although some researchers have postulated three and 
four stages. </p>
<p>The first stage represents a steady state of readiness to have the 
headache and is sometimes associated with unusual neurological and 
neuropsychological phenomenon, but no headache. Some of the best 
descriptions of this stage of migraine activity can be found throughout 
Oliver Sacks’ book “Migraine” (Sacks, 1992). </p>
<p>The second stage is the headache. This often occurs on sudden relief 
from a prolonged period of psychological or physiological stress 
(Diamond, 1994). The fact that the second stage of a migraine correlates
 with excessive dilation of cerebrovascular structures was one of the 
pieces of data that caused migraine researchers to erroneously 
hypothesize a cerebrovascular pathophysiological mechanism. The 
excessive vasodilation appears to be a migraine effect rather than 
cause. It probably participates in pain generation rather than 
originates the pain (Goadsby, 2001).</p>
<p>Within the field of headache research, the standard for headache 
classification is still the International Headache Society (IHS) manual 
(Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache 
Society, 1988). The classification categories set forth in this manual 
represented an attempt to stabilize headache categories for the purpose 
of communicating research findings. </p>
<p>These classification categories were set forth at a time when the 
understanding of the pathophysiology of migraine was less clear than it 
is currently. Now that migraines have been subjected to sophisticated 
imaging techniques such as fMRI and PET, the precise pathophysiology is 
still unclear, although it is more clear now than when the IHS 
classification system was developed. </p>
<p>The theory of migraine pathophysiology that currently has the most 
support among migraine researchers is that migraine is involved with and
 possibly caused by paroxysmal activity of the trigeminovascular system 
(Goadsby, 2001). This system includes all branches of the trigeminal 
nerve, the entire cerebrovascular system, as well as the brainstem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
 is even unclear as to whether or not primary migraine (that which is 
not caused by head trauma or disease) represents pathology at all. Most 
physiologically based behaviors and internal mechanisms that permeate 
the entire human race probably have their origins in evolutionary 
variables (Pinker, 1997). Loader (2002) suggested that the 
migraine-prone nervous system might have had a variety of reproductive 
survival advantages such as causing a reactive compensation to 
environmental conditions that produced global brain hypoperfusion, or 
alternatively producing a learned avoidance of external environmental 
conditions such as ingestion of toxic plants that would trigger migraine
 headaches. In a similar manner Carmen (2002) hypothesized that the 
tendency of migraine sufferers to trigger a headache as a direct 
correlate of the sudden drop in barometric pressure of an approaching 
storm may once have correlated with a reproductive survival advantage by
 serving as an early warning system to seek shelter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hypothesized mechanisms for the effects of pIR HEG on migraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The positive effects on migraine management after exposure to the pIR
 HEG system when the sensor assembly is placed in the center of the 
forehead, behave in a manner consistent with a global increase in the 
amount of control generated by the inhibitory and regulatory functions 
of the prefrontal cortex (Goldberg, 2001). Using an electronic circuit 
analogy, this would be equivalent to increasing the gain of the negative
 feedback loop in which a portion of an output signal is fed back to the
 input to reduce the output. Negative feedback circuits are inherently 
stable. (Madhu, 1985)</p>
<p>This inhibitory hypothesis is based in part on the following observations:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patients being treated for migraine 
headaches using pIR HEG consistently report spontaneous changes in 
attending behavior in the direction of easier and smoother sustained 
attention to tasks. Correlated with this is a reduced distractibility to
 both internal and external stimuli.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patients being treated for migraine 
headaches using pIR HEG consistently report spontaneous changes in 
emotional reactivity in the direction of emotional responses that are 
less rapid and less strong in response to stimuli that don’t call for a 
rapid and strong emotional response.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pIR HEG requires a significant 
amount cognitive “effort”; a concept first clearly defined by Pribram 
&amp; McGuinness (1975). Sometimes during the first session or two this 
sustained effort appears to produce the functional equivalent of 
prefrontal cortical fatigue. When this happens, the behavioral effects 
appear to be those of disinhibition (difficulty attending to task, rage 
reactions, severe migraine activity) for the rest of the day. Typically 
on the following day after a good night’s sleep, inhibitory functions 
are normal or better than normal for that person, suggesting some sort 
of an exercise/ rest/recovery mechanism.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">METHODS</p>
<p>General. </p>
<p>This is a collection of cases not a controlled study. The results 
must be viewed within that context. The setting was a clinical setting 
rather than a research setting. Also, pIR HEG was not the only 
intervention variable. At each session, attempts were made to maximize 
migraine management effects beyond just using the pIR HEG system. These 
additional variables included but were not limited to the following:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussion of eating patterns and food triggers.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussion of stress response patterns.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussion of less obvious potential
 triggers such as the driving effects of visual flicker sources. </p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behavioral methods of migraine management.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behavioral and insight oriented psychotherapy as needed.</p>
<p>These additional interventions represent a potential source of 
contamination in terms of isolating effects to the application of pIR 
HEG. However, there is one built-in control over the effects of these 
additional interventions. They are the same additional interventions 
that were used with the biofeedback based migraine intervention 
techniques previously used by Carmen that were considerably less 
effective than pIR HEG (Carmen, 2002). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subjects. </p>
<p>This population represents a heterogeneous group of 100 patients who 
participated in migraine treatment using the pIR HEG system. There was 
only one selection criteria applied. All patients met the criteria for 
at least one of the migraine categories set forth in the IHS 
classification criteria for headache disorders for primary migraine 
headaches (IHS, 1988). Patients whose migraines were secondary to head 
injury or an active disease process were excluded.</p>
<p>Typically patients were referred by a neurologist or primary care physician, due to one of three reasons: </p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor response to medication.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerns about the potential 
negative effects of medication, including the risk of fetal effects 
during pregnancy as well as potential health risks directly to the 
migraine patient.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerns about addiction to migraine medications. </p>
<p>In most cases migraine medications represent an acceptable 
risk/benefit ratio. However, there is one uniquely serious risk 
category. The&nbsp; “triptans” that represent the current standard of 
care for aborting migraines have been documented to constrict coronary 
arteries and occasionally produce death through this mechanism (Tepper, 
2001). Anyone who has coronary risk factors or active coronary disease 
is generally prohibited from using these drugs. For these people, 
behavioral treatments may represent a medical necessity rather than 
optional choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Procedure variables.</p>
<p>Real world environments are not as well controlled as research 
environments. For these 100 patients, length of active work with the pIR
 HEG system was generally limited to 30 minutes within each office 
visit, but was sometimes less than 30 minutes if fatigue, increase in 
headache, or fading attention made continuing difficult. Sessions were 
usually scheduled once per week, although sometimes sessions were less 
frequent due to scheduling conflicts. Sessions were eventually spread 
out to weeks and months between sessions, based on how long the patient 
was maintaining migraine management. Morning was given preference for 
time of day, but the actual time of the sessions was also determined by 
personal variables such as school and work schedules. The total number 
of sessions was determined by patient preference. Often the response of 
the headache to the pIR HEG sessions was rapid but not complete, and 
patients would elect to continue sessions, progressively increasing the 
number of days between sessions, to fine tune the migraine management. 
Other times, significant improvement was considered sufficient, leaving 
the remaining headaches to be managed with medication or simply 
tolerated. Sometimes more sessions were scheduled to work on other 
aspects of self management, even though the migraines were under stable 
regulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basic descriptive data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Table #1 provides a breakdown of the sex and age of 100 subjects. This 
reflects the relatively higher ratio of females to males in the general 
population who suffer from migraines (Marcus, 1999). The female to male 
ratio in this study is approximately 2:1, which is similar to the ratio 
of 3:1 reported by Lipton et. al. (2001). The ages of the 100 subjects 
are somewhat younger than the general population suffering from 
migraines (Lipton et. al. 2001). The slight differences in age and sex 
between these 100 subjects and the general population probably reflect 
the age and reason people in this geographical region seek treatment (or
 are referred for treatment). </p>

<p>Instrumentation. </p>
<p>The pIR HEG system began to be used clinically in September, 1998 
(Carmen, 2002). The system captures infrared radiation, within the 7 to 
14 micron band, with a center weighted circular field of view of 32mm. 
The thermal resolution is .01 represented in the equivalent of degrees 
Fahrenheit. Based on the physics of thermal transmission (Fraden, 1996),
 the best estimate of the area of the brain to which the system is most 
sensitive would approximate the size and shape of a golf ball, directly 
under the center of the field of view of the sensor assembly. The sensor
 assembly for the pIR HEG system is mounted on the forehead, recording 
infrared light waves emitted from the forehead in much the same way that
 a camera records visible light waves reflected from objects.</p>
<p>The thermal activity picked up by the pIR HEG system reflects excess 
thermal energy generated by the brain as a function of brain activity. 
Increases in the pIR HEG signal reflect a composite of thermal energy 
generated by brain cells, vascular supply and vascular return, although 
there is disagreement among researchers as to which source represents 
the largest thermal contribution to the increase. Some researchers have 
hypothesized that the major contribution of the thermal increase comes 
from brain cells (Kiyaikin, 2002). Others have hypothesized that it 
comes mostly from the vascular system, (Swerdlow and Dieter, 1991). 
Shevelev (1992) is more supportive of the composite hypothesis. </p>
<p>Regardless of the source, it seems reasonable to view the pIR HEG 
signal as a thermal waste product of increased brain activity (Carmen, 
2002). Whereas the relative magnitude of source contributions to the pIR
 HEG signal remains an unresolved issue, the only thing that is of 
immediate importance to treatment issues is that increases in the pIR 
HEG signal are localized and follow increases in localized brain 
activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
second type of equipment was also used, but for data collection only 
rather than as a feedback source. This equipment was not used with all 
patients because it was only available for the last two of the fours 
years. This additional equipment is not part of the pIR HEG system, but 
is used as a means of monitoring the effects of training. It is an 
infrared video capture system that captures changes in infrared patterns
 as thermal energy is emitted from the forehead as a function of focal 
changes in brain activity.</p>
<p>Infrared image capture systems.</p>
<p>The initial system was a STARSIGHT model 80 camera manufactured by 
Insight Vision Systems (Malvern, England). This camera failed after one 
year of use, and since it is no longer being manufactured, repair parts 
were not available. It used older technology and had relatively poor 
image quality. The thermal resolving power was too unstable to 
accurately specify. </p>
<p>The STARSIGHT was replaced with a Raytheon 4000b digital core 
(Raytheon Corporation, Dallas, Texas), modified for the capture of 
infrared images of the head. The thermal resolution of this system is 
.04 degrees Fahrenheit equivalent. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Both systems are similar in some respects.&nbsp; They both match the 7 
to 14 micron spectral range of the pIR HEG system. What they “see” 
corresponds to the data captured by the pIR HEG system. They both use a 
50mm, f1.0 lens, and have a pixel resolution of 240x320. However the 
electronic processing of the signal is so different between the 
STARSIGHT and the Raytheon camera systems that the images captured are 
not directly comparable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
For both systems, image capture from the camera to the Windows 2000 
based computer was carried out using an Integral Technologies FP3D 
industrial frame grabber using the Integral Technologies software 
designed for that particular hardware (Integral Technologies, 
Indianapolis, Indiana).</p>
<p>Part of the pIR HEG process involves watching a video, the operation 
of which is regulated by a threshold setting on the pIR HEG system. The 
VCR used was a Hitachi FX6404, displayed on a standard 20 inch JVC 
television, viewed at a distance of 8 feet.</p>
<p>Additional Specifications. </p>
<p>The sensor assembly for the pIR HEG system has a response speed of 80
 milliseconds. Response speed is defined by the industry standard 
definition of the time required to reach 67% of the full value of the 
object being measured (Fraden, 1996). The sensor assembly picks up the 
infrared radiation from the surface of the forehead as blackbody 
radiation and then converts the infrared signal into a dc signal that is
 fed to the input of the pIR HEG computer. The signal is then processed 
and converted to a green digital LED display. Each LED is .56 inch in 
height. The data sampling rate is 60 times per second. The display 
update rate is 3.5 times per second. The display presents the data as a 
temperature equivalent in degrees Fahrenheit with a resolution of .01 
degree. There are no electrodes used, so there is no direct electrical 
contact with the patient. The system also interfaces with a universal 
remote control that provides threshold based control over external 
audiovisual sources such as a VCR or DVD. A threshold is set on the 
internal computer, above which a movie will turn on, and below which the
 same movie will turn off. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 61
 of the 100 subjects were also monitored with one of two of the infrared
 image capture systems previously described. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Procedure. </p>
<p>For those subjects who began treatment after the installation of the 
infrared video system, an image capture was carried out before and after
 each session. A baseline image was captured and stored in digital tiff 
format. At the end of the session a second image was captured. Images 
were captured using the 50 mm lens set at f1.0, at a distance of 3 feet 
from the subject. With the Raytheon system, the maximum thermal capture 
range was set in software at a 10 degree Fahrenheit equivalent.</p>
<p>In the next step, the sensor assembly was placed on the forehead so 
that the center of the field of view was in the center of the forehead, 
roughly at Fpz. (See figure 1). It was held in place with soft hook and 
loop straps just tightly enough to prevent slippage. Since the sensor 
assembly acquires light wave infrared data, direct physical contact with
 the forehead is only necessary to the extent that it prevents movement 
of the sensor assembly.</p>
<p>Image #1 is an infrared image of the author wearing the sensor 
assembly on his forehead, captured with the Raytheon camera. Please note
 two significant things. First, infrared by definition has no color. All
 of the infrared images in this article have been digitally converted 
from grayscale images (the native format for infrared cameras) to 
something called “false color” (Kaplan, 1999). In this case the colors 
assigned to intensity changes range from black (lowest intensity) to red
 to yellow to white (highest intensity). This color code was selected 
for its intuitive value, since it is the pattern seen on stove burners 
and other heated objects and is easy for people to comprehend the 
meaning of these colors. Second, all images (except the one of the 
author) have been captured with eye glasses removed. Both glass and 
plastic eyeglasses are opaque to this part of the infrared spectrum, 
resulting in a total loss of infrared data from that portion of the face
 covered by the glasses. Glasses were left in place in this picture to 
demonstrate that mechanism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="100.php_files/image%25201.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Typically for migraine, the center of the forehead is the only location
 used.&nbsp; With humans this is a unique location. The human forehead 
is devoid of hair, making it an ideal location for the radiation of 
excess thermal energy from the brain. It also makes it an ideal location
 for recording thermal activity from the prefrontal cortex. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
After the baseline infrared image was captured, the sensor assembly was 
placed on the forehead and the pIR HEG display turned on. At the same 
time, a movie (selected by the subject) was started. After several 
minutes a threshold was set above the current display reading, causing 
the VCR to place the movie on “pause”. This required the subject to 
increase the pIR HEG signal to a point in excess of the threshold 
setting in order to turn the movie back on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The mental state that produces the maximum output of infrared radiation 
from the forehead is a simultaneous combination of the following:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very low levels of discomfort such as anxiety, anger, or frustration.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very intense levels of sustained concentration.</p>
<p>This is an affective/cognitive combination that usually does not feel
 familiar or intuitive. However most were able to learn the concept 
within a minute or two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Headache measures. </p>
<p>Most, if not all headache research also includes some sort of pain 
index. A review of the last 5 years of the IHS journal, Cephalalgia 
revealed various pain scales from 0 to 3, all the way up to 0 to 100. 
Some researchers also used faces that smile or frown as a correlated 
measure of pain. The commonality of these measures among all the studies
 is that the lowest number or face represents no pain and the highest 
number or face represents the worst pain the person can imagine. There 
is however a problem with all of these measures. When headaches start to
 improve, people forget how bad the headaches used to be. Without 
realizing it, they start to assign higher numbers to headaches of pain 
levels to which they used to assign lower numbers. </p>
<p>All of the subjects included in this study rated their headaches on a
 0 to 10 scale. However, the only consistently reliable number was “0”. 
Regardless of the rating system used, total lack of pain is a stable, 
universal concept.</p>
<p>An additional, and probably more stable migraine change measure is 
the point at which the person reports having a headache, but is no 
longer able to tell whether it was a migraine or not. That was the 
primary head pain change measure used in this study to measure 
“significant improvement”.</p>
<p>It is a concept that at face value appears vague, but has turned out 
to be one of the more robust measures, at least for the people in this 
study. For people who are still getting some headaches, this is a more 
useful measure than “no pain” because it reflects the point at which the
 headaches are discernable but not troublesome. Although it does not 
have a numeric intensity equivalent, it appears to be a more reliable 
and valid measure. It also allows a frequency measure to continue as an 
added headache variable.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this study, “significant improvement” has been 
functionally defined as that point at which the subject was still 
getting some headaches but was unable to clearly identify them as 
migraine because the pain level was so much less.</p>
<p>Infrared imaging provided a different type of measure. Although it 
reliably displayed patterns of thermal energy emitted through the 
forehead, for many of the subjects the migraine itself was visible. 
During a migraine headache, the painful areas of the head were often 
visible as high output areas on the infrared image. Although the meaning
 of this is not entirely clear in terms of the underlying 
pathophysiological mechanisms, the correlation with pain and location is
 very high. Typically subjects who viewed the image would spontaneously 
say something like “that’s exactly where it hurts”. The intensity of 
this image reliably decreased by the end of the session, even though the
 output of the forehead region increased. In addition, the amount of the
 reduction of the intensity of the headache area correlated with the 
pain reduction by the end of the session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">SAMPLE CASES</p>
<p>Color code. The following cases were drawn from those for whom 
infrared images were available. The images follow a color code of 
thermal output ranging from black (least thermal output) to red to 
yellow to white (most thermal output). Migraine activity is generally 
correlated with yellow, and sometimes white. The reference color bar is 
inserted below as image #2. Each bar in this image reflects a 1.0 degree
 Fahrenheit equivalent. Actual captured images display a minimum 
resolvable temperature difference (MRTD) (Kaplan, 1999) that is much 
more sensitive, by blending colors and intensities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="100.php_files/image%25202.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patient #90. </p>
<p>This was a 15 year old male, referred for 4 years of headache 
activity that had evolved into chronic migraine activity of variable 
pain level for the previous 6 months. There was no identified disease 
process associated with the headache activity. He had a strong family 
history for migraines. That combined with the family history suggested a
 familial/genetic etiology. He had been on a variety of prophylactic 
medications but they were having minimal to no effect. Abortive 
prescription and over the counter (OTC) medications had been taken as 
often as daily. There were no identifiable environmental triggers. He 
was an excellent student but not attending school when first entered 
treatment due to the headache activity. He would wake with a mild to 
moderate headache daily, 7 days per week, including vacations. Migraines
 that are active 7 days a week and on vacations tend to be especially 
stubborn. His headaches would usually become gradually worse by 
afternoon and get somewhat better after abortive medication. The 
location of the headaches was unstable, sometimes focal and sometimes 
generalized throughout the whole head. Appointments were scheduled for 
mornings when headache activity was at the lowest level, because high 
pain levels made concentration difficult. Parts of his face are “grayed 
out” in these images to help preserve anonymity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Even after the first session, the low level headache that he came in 
with was gone by the end of the session. Initially, the relief obtained 
was temporary and did not last more than one day. As the sessions 
progressed, the headache control lasted progressively longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
 session #5 he came in with a severe left sided posterior migraine that 
he rated as a “10” on a 0 to 10 pain scale. The baseline infrared image 
(IMAGE #3) is inserted here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="100.php_files/image%25203.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a 30 minute session of pIR HEG, the pain level dropped to “3 or 4” pain level. That image (IMAGE #4) is inserted here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="100.php_files/image%25204.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IMAGE 4 shows a post session lower intensity of thermal output in the
 left posterior region of his head, corresponding to a reduced level of 
pain. Both pre and post images delineated almost exactly the area of his
 head pain.</p>
<p>On session #10 he came in with the same headache in the same location
 but the pain level was so low that the actual level was very difficult 
to determine. This is an example of the type of change that is 
considered “significant improvement”. He could feel it, but not 
strongly. He rated it as a “1”. That image is inserted here as IMAGE #5.
 Note, hair interferes with infrared transmission in these frequencies. 
The yellow mark in the back of his head is where the hair is parted and 
does not represent pathological signal intensity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="100.php_files/image%25205.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By
 session #12 the headache activity was no longer chronic, all 
medications were discontinued, and he was back in school. Sessions were 
stretched to one every 3 weeks. By session #17 he was still getting 
occasional mild headaches, lasting an average of 30 minutes. He was no 
longer using abortive or prophylactic medication, and headaches were no 
longer interfering with his life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Comments: This case used more sessions than most, but may have had 
elements of rebounding from excessive medication use. It is not typical 
to be able to image migraines as precisely as these, which is one reason
 for the inclusion of this particular case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patient #3. </p>
<p>This was an 11 year old pre-pubescent female who had been getting 
focal and generalized migraines for the previous two years. They varied 
from daily to weekly, usually towards the end of the day. There was no 
identified disease process associated with the headache activity. 
Everyone in the immediate family had migraines, making a 
familial/genetic etiology a high probability. The only medications used 
were OTC analgesics and then only for the very severe headaches. She 
responded very rapidly. By the 6<sup>th</sup> session she was under complete control with no headaches. At a two month follow-up there were no further headaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Comments: Migraines often start up in girls as adolescent hormones start
 to kick in, and it is not unusual for the migraines to begin prior to 
the onset of first menstruation. One to two years prior is somewhat 
typical. Often as adolescence progresses, the migraines get worse. In 
this case it is too early to tell whether they are just completely gone,
 or if she will be back in another year or two with another bout of 
severe headaches. In any case, based on experience with others, if she 
does have a recurrence, it will probably take less work than the first 
time to bring them back under control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Image #6 is her first session baseline without headache present. The 
relatively dark frontal image suggests relatively low overall prefrontal
 brain activity. Experience suggests that this can be either part of the
 problem in terms of allowing the brainstem migraine generator to be too
 active, or it could be a product of being in pain much of the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="100.php_files/image%25206.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Image #7 is the baseline image from the second session. She came in with
 a left frontal migraine, which imaged nicely in yellow around the area 
of the left temporal artery, which is the area to which the migraine was
 localized. This does not mean that the migraine was being generated by 
the left temporal artery, although it might have been. That still 
represents a theoretical issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="100.php_files/image%25207.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Image #8 is the post session image from the same session. The migraine 
is not completely gone, but down from severe to mild (“8” down to “3” by
 her rating).&nbsp; Note that the right and left sides of the forehead 
are reasonably balanced in terms of thermal output, and that the dark 
areas of the forehead are less dark. In many patients, the dark areas 
appear to take on meaning in terms of focal brain activity deficits and 
tend to correlate with emotions and attentional patterns. However as a 
general guideline, when the dark areas become lighter, people feel 
better physically and mentally.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Image #9 is the baseline image from the final (6<sup>th</sup>)
 session. This is significantly lighter in the forehead region, 
indicating greater prefrontal brain activity. There was no headache 
present and no further headaches were reported on 1 and 2 month 
follow-up.</p>
<p><img src="100.php_files/image%25209.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
 is not unusual for these forehead infrared images to become 
progressively lighter over time. This generally correlates with symptom 
reduction and may indicate a general increase in normal prefrontal 
cortical activity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patient #37. </p>
<p>This 24 year old woman started and finished treatment prior to the 
installation of either of the infrared imaging systems, but is worth 
mentioning because of the urgency of the situation. She had a long 
standing history of severe migraines since early adolescence. The 
migraines were debilitating when they occurred but tended to be 
infrequent. They sometimes hit once a week, sometimes once a month, 
sometimes months between migraines. These were managed reasonably well 
with various abortive medications. Most recently she had been very 
successfully managing her migraines using oral Imitrex. Imitrex is the 
first of the new breed of drugs called “triptans”, and for many people 
has allowed them to live much more normal lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The problem is that this young woman found herself pregnant, and 
although sometimes migraines get better during pregnancy (Marcus, 1999),
 hers got worse. The triptan drugs are powerful vasoconstrictors, and 
have been shown in animal studies to have teratogenic effects (Tepper, 
2001). She needed an alternate way to manage her migraines during 
pregnancy, that did not carry potential risks to the health of the 
unborn baby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The migraines came under rapid control, reducing first in intensity and 
then frequency. (As previously noted, reduction in frequency is a 
difficult thing to measure because if the intensity is reduced 
sufficiently it is difficult to tell if a migraine actually happened or 
not). In any case, after 3 sessions over a period of 3 weeks, her 
migraines seemed to be greatly diminished or completely gone, depending 
on the criteria used for defining the headaches. 5 more sessions were 
completed just because it seemed like a good idea. There was some 
continued headache activity through the balance of her pregnancy but it 
was unclear whether or not they were migraines or just general pregnancy
 related mild to moderate headaches. They did not require medication for
 pain management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patient #49. </p>
<p>This 41 year old woman had been suffering from severe migraines for 
the previous 6 years. They were severe enough to require occasional 
trips to the local emergency room for injected narcotics. Prophylactic 
and abortive medications had been only somewhat useful. Frequency varied
 from 1 per month to almost daily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This case is less clear than the others in terms of etiology. Her mother
 also had occasional migraines, but not with such a severe frequency or 
intensity. Correlated with the onset of her migraines was severe chronic
 psychological stress from both work and home. She slept very poorly in 
that she would toss and turn all night and wake exhausted. The sleep 
patterns would rise and fall with the amount of psychological stress she
 was experiencing, although it was not clear as to whether the sinusitis
 played a role as well. In addition, there were a variety of comorbid 
physical disorders that fall into the category of “migraine aggravators”
 rather than migraine causes. These included temporomandibular joint 
problems, chronic bilateral maxillary sinus infections, and some ill 
defined generalized health problems. The headaches correlated positively
 with her menstrual cycle in that one severe migraine was predictable 
premenstrually. Others could come at any time. Usually she woke with a 
mild dull headache that was qualitatively different from the migraine. 
The migraine was usually left sided and throbbing. The morning headache 
was more generalized and dull. In terms of etiology, this is a difficult
 diagnostic judgment call. While there was probably a genetic component,
 there were enough physical problems to possibly account for the 
headaches. Also, the relatively late onset of the migraines is a little 
suspicious for secondary rather than primary migraine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Surprisingly, her response to pIR HEG was very rapid, although the rapid
 response did not hold for extended periods of time. The other physical 
and psychological stressors remained relatively constant, but her 
migraines got better between sessions. This suggested that these 
migraines were in fact primary rather than being caused by some other 
physical disorder, although the physical problems were clearly making 
management difficult. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
She completed 11 pIR HEG sessions over a period of 6 months. The first 5
 sessions were 1 per week. After that the sessions were spread farther 
apart. Each session had what appeared to be both abortive and 
prophylactic effects. If she came in with a migraine, she left either 
without it, or greatly diminished. Any migraine activity between 
sessions was greatly diminished in terms of intensity. After the first 5
 visits, her life became too complex to continue except on an 
intermittent basis. She would still get approximately 7 days of improved
 migraine control from each session, but the headaches would still creep
 back to previous levels by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> week. She still comes in for an occasional session, but on an irregular basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This case represents a very complex set of circumstances. It has been 
included here as an example of the potential complexity of working with 
migraine headaches, since they usually seem to be affected if not 
actually driven by life stressors. The pIR HEG sessions clearly helped 
her a great deal. However she also had been living under unbelievable 
levels of psychological and physical stress, so it is not likely that 
the migraines were going to disappear altogether. In cases like this, 
sometimes it seems worthwhile to continue weekly sessions for a long 
period of time, or switch to home training. However in her particular 
life situation, neither was a viable option. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
 is likely that when her life circumstances straighten out and her 
physical problems start to become less intense, her migraines will also 
become less troublesome. When that happens, further pIR HEG sessions may
 bring her migraines under exceptionally smooth control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Image #10 is a baseline from a recent scheduled session. She came in 
with a very bad migraine, localized to the right temporal region. In the
 image, that region can be seen to be relatively brighter and covering a
 relatively larger area than the left side. The “wings” on either side 
of her head are her hands holding her hair out of the picture. This was 
also unusual for her in that most of her migraines have been left sided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="100.php_files/image%252010.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Image #11 was captured immediately after the session was completed. The 
headache was completely gone.</p>
<p><img src="100.php_files/image%252011.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The thermal output from the forehead on this image shows less of a 
right/left difference, and the forehead is generally lighter in color, 
indicating increased overall prefrontal cortical activity. The same 
caveats apply in this situation as the previous two sets of images. 
These images correlate with migraine pain or lack of it. They may or may
 not represent the underlying physiological mechanism generating the 
pain. Regardless, the reliability of these images is very high. The 
utility of these images becomes greater when studied as specific 
patterns that are unique to each individual. Under those conditions, 
they become predictable and useful, especially as part of an ongoing 
differential diagnostic process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">RESULTS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The typical response pattern for all those who improved was to have the 
intensity level of the migraines change before anything else changed. 
The headaches, when they occurred were less intense. The point of 
“significant improvement” was defined as the point at which it had 
become difficult to identify headaches as “migraine”. From the 
standpoint of headache patterns, the focal location of the pain usually 
remained the same as the “migraines”, but the pain level was much less, 
sometimes becoming almost indiscernible. </p>
<p>Reduction in headache frequency typically came weeks or months after 
reduction in pain levels. This is an even more complex and unreliable 
measure than pain level because as pain levels drop it becomes more and 
more difficult to determine if a headache (migraine) actually happened. 
Detailed questioning has revealed that many people will continue to have
 very low intensity “events” that are probably actual migraines but have
 an intensity so low that it requires very careful data collection for 
identification as a migraine. Often they are not even identified as 
headaches. Sometimes the only way to identify them is by patterns of 
events. For example, if the person’s migraines typically triggered on a 
Friday after a long hard week, that person might continue to have very 
low intensity “events” at the time and day that they used to get a 
migraine headache. These are probably still migraine headaches, but they
 lack intensity. These “events” can be non pain events that present only
 as altered sensations. This observation may lend support to the 
hypothesis that the mechanism of action of the pIR HEG system on 
migraine headaches is through inhibition of the migraine generator. 
Functionally the migraines appear to become weaker. It may be that the 
frequency actually remains constant. Self reports are inadequate for 
this level of discrimination, and the infrared images are so sensitive 
to intensity that they don’t help much either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The decision to terminate treatment was typically based on a variety of 
variables, most of them personal. Given the option of continuing 
sessions as long as needed, they were continued weekly until the 
headaches had stabilized to a comfortable point. Then the sessions were 
spread out progressively farther apart until a mutual agreement was 
reached to completely terminate. Personal preferences varied as to the 
degree of migraine management desired. Most were satisfied with relative
 freedom from debilitating headaches, relying to some extent on 
medication for the occasional very bad headache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
For those 61 individuals for whom pre/post infrared images were 
recorded, the following observations also apply:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strongest correlate of the 
impact of the session was a decrease in dark areas in the image rather 
than the total increase in lightness of the image. This is somewhat 
consistent with the “cold patch” observed by Swerdlow &amp; Dieter 
(1991). However because of the age and technology of their infrared 
camera, their images are not directly comparable with either of the 
image data sets in this study.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For both males and females, the majority started to see signs of 
improvement in 6 sessions or less. Of the 36 males in this study, 23 
improved enough in 6 sessions to consider themselves significantly 
improved. Of the 64 females, 38 improved enough in 6 sessions to 
consider themselves significantly improved. Most continued on for more 
sessions, terminating when it felt comfortable or when the financial or 
time inconvenience of coming to an appointment was greater than the 
inconvenience caused by the relatively minor headaches. The number of 
sessions does appear to have some predictive importance in that most who
 eventually achieved “significant improvement” showed signs of 
improvement by session #6.</p>
<p>A relatively smaller number of males (5) and females (6) took more 
than 6 sessions before they saw signs of improvement. The cutoff point 
of 6 sessions appears to have considerable predictive value in that if 
someone has not seen signs of improvement by session number 6, it is 
only somewhat likely that more sessions will help. For those who needed 
more sessions to see improvement, typically they needed much more. Some 
went as high as 20 or 30 sessions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other observations.</p>
<p>4 people regarded themselves as completely cured. Followup suggests that this may in fact be the case.</p>
<p>Not everyone improved. 8 of the males and 20 of the females did not 
improve at all. However, all of the males who did not improve, and 16 of
 the females who did not improve, had dropped out prior to 6 sessions. 
It is unknown if these would have converted into “significantly 
improved” had they continued.</p>
<p>An analysis of the patterns of reasons for dropping out, showed great
 variability and the reasons given may not have always been the real 
reasons. 1 male and 10 females dropped out for financial reasons. The 
reason for the extreme female/male ratio on this variable is unclear. 
The psychological reasons for dropping out were also quite variable and 
idiosyncratic. Some people were addicted to the migraine medications and
 did not or could not stop taking them. These drugs would often produce a
 once or twice daily rebound headache. Breaking the cycle required a 
total withdrawal from abortive medication, that these people were either
 unwilling or unable to accomplish.</p>
<p>The infrared images added a very useful measure for those for whom it
 was available. If a person came into the session with a headache, 
painful areas could usually be identified as high intensity areas on the
 images. Not everyone came to a session with a headache, but it happened
 often enough to gather some data. Typically the high intensity painful 
areas would reduce to a lower intensity by the end of the session, 
correlated with a reduced pain level. This was a very consistent 
finding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Observations and impressions. </p>
<p>These are general subjective impressions from working directly with 
all of these patients using the pIR HEG process. Most people like the 
process, and learn it quickly, in spite of the fact that the high 
intensity cognitive “effort” combined with a very relaxed emotional 
state is an unfamiliar concept to almost everyone. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The reasons for change in migraine status remain unclear. It is likely 
that the mechanisms involve the inhibitory functions that are closely 
associated with the prefrontal cortex, but at this point that is 
hypothesis rather than proven fact.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">CONCLUSIONS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The results of this study support the observations of other clinicians 
using the pIR HEG system with migraine patients. Migraine patients 
appear to improve strongly, and quickly, usually seeing positive effects
 within the first 6 sessions. In addition, the effects appear to be both
 prophylactic and abortive. Because the system is so new, long term data
 is not yet available. It must still be considered an experimental 
intervention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
More precise pre/post psychophysiological measures such as fMRI, QEEG 
and related imaging processes may eventually help to clarify the 
specific brain mechanisms activated by this process. As more data is 
gathered, it may even contribute meaningful information to ongoing 
attempts to clarify the basic pathophysiological mechanisms associated 
with migraine headaches.</p>
