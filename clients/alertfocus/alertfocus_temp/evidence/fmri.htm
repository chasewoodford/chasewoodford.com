<p>****************************************************************************************&nbsp;<br> <b>New New Evidence Supporting Neurofeedback for Treating ADHD </b>**<br>**************************************************************************************** <br><br>Neurofeedback
 is a popular albeit controversial intervention used in the treatment of
 ADHD. Scientists have known for many years that the brain emits various
 brainwaves that are indicative of the electrical activity of the brain 
and that different types of brainwaves are emitted depending on whether 
the person is in a focused and attentive state or a drowsy/day-dreaming 
state.<br><br>Neurofeedback allows a person to view these brainwaves on a
 computer screen as they occur. By teaching a person to produce 
brainwave patterns that are associated with a relaxed, alert, and 
focused state, and having them practice this skill for many hours of 
training, neurofeedback practitioners contend that individuals with ADHD
 can learn to maintain this state and that many symptoms of ADHD will 
diminish. Many scientists do not believe that such claims have been 
sufficiently documented, however.<br><br>A typical clinical session of 
neurofeedback training for a child with ADHD involves pasting electrodes
 (sensors that pick up the electrical activity of the brain) to the head
 with conductive gel. Wires from these electrodes are connected to a 
device that amplifies the small signal obtained from the electrodes. The
 child sits in a comfortable chair and watches a computer monitor. The 
monitor displays a picture such as a moving graph that indicates the 
degree to which the child is producing the desired pattern of brainwave 
activity. The goal is for the child to learn to produce the type of 
brainwave activity that is associated with a focused and attentive 
state.<br><br>Over the course of numerous training sessions it may 
gradually become easier for the child to achieve this state and to 
maintain it for longer periods of time. Proponents of neurofeedback 
often describe this training as an exercise program for the brain, and 
training continues until the client demonstrates the ability to 
consistently achieve and maintain a pattern of EEG activity indicative 
of a relaxed and attentive state. This typically requires 40-60 
sessions.<br><br>By the conclusion of treatment, neurofeedback advocates
 believe that increases in attention and reductions in impulsivity that 
are evident during training will transfer to important areas of the 
child's life - e.g. home and school - and there are several published 
studies (see below) that are consistent with this position. Critics of 
neurofeedback, however, do not believe there is credible evidence to 
indicate that such transfer occurs.<br><br><br>** <b>Prior Neurofeedback Research Reviewed in Attention Research Update</b> **<br><br>In
 prior issues of Attention Research Update I have reviewed several 
neurofeedback studies that highlight the promise of this approach for 
helping individuals with ADHD. In the first study (Monastra et al., 
2001), 101 children and adolescents with AD/HD received multimodal 
treatment that included stimulant medication, behavioral therapy, and 
school consultation services. Fifty-one of these participants also 
received neurofeedback because their parent(s) decided to include it in 
their child's overall treatment plan. Participants in each group (i.e. 
multimodal treatment vs. multimodal treatment + neurofeedback) did not 
differ in the severity of symptoms before treatment began, and the 
treatment provided differed only by whether it included neurofeedback.<br><br>Twelve
 months later, participants whose treatment included neurofeedback 
showed greater improvement according to parent and teacher behavior 
ratings, and no longer demonstrated the brainwave patterns that were 
substantially different from children without ADHD. These gains remained
 evident a week after medication was discontinued and suggest that 
adding neurofeedback to a multimodal treatment program was associated 
with important incremental benefits. You can find a comprehensive review
 of this study at <a href="http://professionals.c.topica.com/maaesLjabn4rgbecnpMc/">www.helpforadd.com/2003/january.htm</a>.<br><br>In
 a second study (Fuchs et al., 2003), parents of 34 children with AD/HD 
between the ages of 8 and 12 chose either stimulant medication or 
neurofeedback treatment for their child. The majority - the parents of 
22 children -- opted for neurofeedback treatment. After 3 months, 
children in both groups showed significant and comparable reductions in 
ADHD symptoms according to parents and teachers. Laboratory tests of 
attention also showed equivalent improvement. A comprehensive review of 
this study is available at <a href="http://professionals.c.topica.com/maaesLjabn4rhbecnpMc/">www.helpforadd.com/2003/april.htm</a>.<br><br>Clearly,
 children in both studies who received neurofeedback appeared to benefit
 from this treatment. Critics of these studies would correctly point 
out, however, that neither employed random assignment. The absence of 
random assignment makes it impossible to rule out other factors the 
groups may have differed on - besides whether they received 
neurofeedback - as an explanation for the results obtained. This 
limitation is found in virtually all studies of neurofeedback.<br><br>Another
 limitation is the failure to control for the substantial extra 
therapist attention provided to children who received neurofeedback 
treatment. It is possible that this extra attention - and not 
neurofeedback training per se - is what accounts for children's 
improvement. Although this strikes us unlikely given the intractability 
of ADHD symptoms to adult attention and support alone, it cannot be 
conclusively ruled out as an explanation.<br><br><br>**<b> New Study of Neurofeedback for Treating ADHD </b>**<br><br>A
 recently published study addresses one of these important concerns, 
i.e., the absence of random assignment, and also provides direct 
evidence of changes in brain activity for children receiving 
neurofeedback (Levesque, J., Beauregard, M., &amp; Mensour, B. 2006. 
Effect of neurofeedback training on the neural substrates of selective 
attention in children with AD/HD: A functional magnetic resonance 
imaging study. <i>Neuroscience Letters, 394,</i> 216-221.)<br><br>Participants
 were 20 8-12-year-old children (4 girls and 16 boys) meeting DSM-IV 
criteria for ADHD; children who were also diagnosed with learning 
disabilities or a psychiatric diagnosis in addition to ADHD were 
excluded. Fifteen children were randomly assigned to receive 40 
hour-long sessions of neurofeedback training conducted over a 13-week 
period. More children were assigned to the treatment group so that a 
greater number of treated subjects could participate in the fMRI 
procedure described below.<br><br>Consistent with what is known about 
EEG (i.e., brainwave) activity in individuals with ADHD, training 
focused on reducing the production of lower frequency theta waves and 
increasing the production of higher frequency waves that are associated 
with a more focused and attentive state. Control children received no 
active intervention, nor did they receive comparable amounts of adult 
attention. Although children in both groups had received stimulant 
medication treatment prior to the study, no child received medication 
during the study.<br><br><br>** <b>STUDY MEASURES</b> **<br><br>Both 
before and after neurofeedback training, the following measures were 
collected on participants in the treatment and control groups:<br><br><br>1) Parent ratings of ADHD symptoms;<br><br>2) <b>Digit Span Test</b>-
 This test requires children to repeat in correct order strings of 
digits that are read to them. The strings get increasingly longer until 
the child fails 2 trials in succession. After failing 2 successive 
trials, the test is repeated with children required to repeat the digits
 back in reverse order. Performance on this test depends on both 
attention and working memory skills.<br><br>3) <b>Continuous Performance Test</b>
 - This is a computerized test of sustained attention and the ability to
 inhibit impulsive responding. In this test, the child is presented with
 a series of auditory and visual stimuli via computer and must either 
respond or inhibit responding by pressing particular keys according to 
the stimulus that is presented. To well on this task, children need to 
sustain careful attention and refrain from pressing keys impulsively 
when the wrong stimulus is presented. This measure is widely used in the
 evaluation of attention difficulties.<br><br>4) <b>Counting Stroop Task</b>
 - This is a complex experimental task that involves both selective 
attention and the ability to inhibit a well-learned response. In this 
task, children are told that they will see sets of 1-4 identical words 
appear on the computer screen. Their job is to indicate how many words 
were presented by pressing a button the appropriate number of times.<br><br>On
 some trials, the words consisted of names of common animals, e.g., dog,
 cat, bird, etc.). For example, the word "cat" would appear 3 times and 
the child would need to press the button 3 times. If the word appeared 
only once, the child would press the button once. During these "neutral"
 trials, the task was thus relatively easy.<br><br>On other trials, 
however, referred to as "interference" trials, number words, e.g., 
"one", "two", "three", appeared on the screen. For example, the word 
"one" might be written 3 times, requiring the child to button press 3 
times. This is a more difficult task, however, because the content of 
the word - the number one - conflicts with the number of button presses 
the child must make. Because what the child reads interferes with how 
he/she must respond, the processing required to do well on these trials 
is more complex than when neutral animal words are presented. Prior 
research has demonstrated that different brain areas are activated 
during these different types of trials. (Note - This is a variant of the
 more familiar color Stroop task, in which it is harder to name the 
color that words are printed in when the ink color is different from the
 word itself, e.g., when color words are written in green ink, it takes 
longer to say the ink is gren when the word written is "red" than when 
the word written is "green". You can try this for youself at <a href="http://professionals.c.topica.com/maaesLjabn4ribecnpMc/">http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/words.html</a> <br><br>All
 children completed the Counting Stroop Task both before and after those
 in the experimental group received neurofeedback treatment. A total of 
120 "neutral" and "interference" trials were conducted during each 
testing session and children's score was the number of trials they 
answered correctly.<br><br>An especially important feature of this study
 is that children received fMRI scans as while completing the Counting 
Stroop Task. FMRI is a technique for determining which parts of the 
brain are activated as individuals perform certain tasks by "imaging" 
the increased blood flow to the activated areas of the brain.<br><br>The
 inclusion of fMRI scans during the Counting Stroop Task enabled the 
researchers to examine results on this task in 2 ways. First, they could
 determine whether treated children performed better after treatment 
compared to the control group. And, second, they could determine via 
fMRI data whether patterns of brain activation during the task changed 
in neurofeedback treated children. Because neurofeedback is intended to 
change the underlying pattern of brain activity, demonstrating such a 
change is an important step in documenting the efficacy of this 
approach.<br><br><br>** <b>RESULTS</b> **<br><br>Results indicated clear
 improvements for children receiving neurofeedback treatment. 
Specifically, the authors reported the following:<br><br><br>1) For 
treated children, parent ratings of inattentive ADHD symptoms declined 
significantly - into the normal range - while those of control children 
remained clinically elevated.<br><br>2) For treated children, parent 
ratings of hyperactive/impulsive ADHD symptoms declined significantly - 
although not quite into the normal range - while those of control 
children showed a modest increase.<br><br>3) On the Digit Span test, 
scores for treated children increased significantly from time 1 to time 
2; for control children, no significant increase was found.<br><br>4) On
 the Continuous Performance Test, scores for treated children increased 
significantly from time 1 to time 2; for control children, no 
significant increase was found.<br><br>5) On the Counting Stroop Task, 
treated children performed significantly better on both neutral and 
interference trials at time 2 compared to time 1; for control children, 
no increase in the accuracy of their performance was found.<br><br>6) 
FMRI results showed no difference in patterns of brain activation 
between treated and control children at time 1. At time 2, however, 
treated children showed a different pattern of brain activation during 
the interference trials, i.e., those that required more complex 
cognitive processing. The brain regions that were now activated were 
those believed to play important roles in selective attention and the 
suppression of inappropriate responses.<br><br><br>** <b>SUMMARY and IMPLICATIONS</b> **<br><br>This
 study provides important new evidence to support the use of 
neurofeedback as a treatment for ADHD. Advantages over several 
previously published neurofeedback studies are that participants were 
randomly assigned to the treatment vs. control conditions and the 
inclusion of fMRI scans to document that neurofeedback treatment was 
associated with actual changes in brain activity during a complex 
cogntive task.<br><br>As with previously published studies, treatment 
was associated with a significant reduction in parent ratings of their 
child's ADHD symptoms. Because parents were not blind to condition, 
however, one can argue that this finding is confounded by parents' 
knowledge of whether or not their child received treatment. In other 
words, parents may have reported their child symptoms to improve simply 
because they expected this would happen and not because objective 
changes actually occurred.<br><br>Improvements for treated children in 
Digit Span and the Continuous Performance test - both considered to be 
objective assessments of attention and other cognitive skills - are not 
subject to this same criticsm, and thus provide a stronger basis for 
suggesting the neurofeedback treatment was helpful.<br><br>Most 
compelling of all, however, is the finding that neurofeedback treatment 
was associated with changes in brain activation detected by fMRI scans 
during the Counting Stoop Task. Proponents of neurofeedback treatment 
have long suggested that it produces enduring changes in brain 
functioning, and it is these changes that cause ADHD symptoms to 
diminish. Results from this study provide important initial evidence 
consistent with this hypothesis, although the absence of any long-term 
follow up makes it impossible to know whether the changes detected were 
transient or enduring.<br><br>While these results are encouraging, a 
balanced review of any study requires a discussion of it's limitations, 
and there are several to note. First, the sample size is relatively 
small and replicating the findings with a larger sample would be 
important.<br><br>Another limitation of the sample is that children with
 learning disabilities and diagnoses in addition to ADHD were excluded. 
Because many children with ADHD have one or more co-occurring conditions
 which can complicate treatment, it is not clear whether the results 
obtained would generalize to a broader and more representative sample of
 children with ADHD.<br><br>Third, the only behavior measure obtained 
fwas rom parents who were not blind to treatment condition. Because 
improving children's behavioral and academic functioning in school is an
 especially important goal of ADHD treatment, the absence of such 
information in this study is problematic; it should not be assumed that 
such changesin the classroom would have occurred. Finally, as the 
authors note, the control participants did not receive any attentional 
training intervention whatsoever. Thus, although it is tempting to 
conclude that specific training in changing brainwave activity was 
responsible for the treatment effects, including changes in the fMRI 
scans, this conclusion cannot be made with certainty.<br><br>For 
example, training a different pattern of EEG activity using 
neurofeedback, or an attention training intervention in which no direct 
feedback on EEG activity was provided, may have yielded similar results.
 One could even argue that the greater contact with researchers received
 by children in the treatment group - 40 hours vs. 0 for those in the 
control group - is what accounted for the treatment gains and that 
neurofeedback itself had nothing to do with it.<br><br>Although I do not
 find this to be a likely explanation, the study design does not enable 
this possibility to conclusively ruled out. In an ideal design, control 
children would go through a neurofeedback procedure that appeared 
identical to what treated children received, only the training would 
provide "sham" feedback that was not linked to their actual EEG 
activity. If group differences were found with this procedure it would 
be a clear indication that the specific EEG training received by 
experimental subjects, rather than any type of "placebo" effect, is what
 caused the improvements.<br><br>While these limitations are important 
to be aware of, the pattern of findings reported add to the increasing 
evidence base for using neurofeedback as a treatment for ADHD. While 
many experts would argue that additional studies are required to clearly
 demonstrate that this is an effective intervention - and I personally 
agree with this statement - it is also important to recognize that a 
number of studies provide converging evidence for the potential value of
 this approach.<br><br>I will continue to publish summaries of new 
studies in this interesting area in Attention Research Update as they 
become available. <br><br>******************************************************************************************<br></p> <br>
