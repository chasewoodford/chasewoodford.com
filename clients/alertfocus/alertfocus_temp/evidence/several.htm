 sources induced by neurofeedback in learning disabled children. An 
exploratory study.&nbsp; Appl. Psychophysiol. Biofeedback, 32(3-4): 
169-183.<br>The objective of this work was to explore Neurofeedback 
(NFB) effects on EEG current sources in Learning Disabled (LD) children,
 and to corroborate its beneficial consequences on behavioral and 
cognitive performance. NFB was given in twenty 30-min sessions to 11 LD 
children to reduce their abnormally high theta/alpha ratios 
(Experimental Group). Another five LD children with the same 
characteristics received a placebo treatment (Control Group). In the 
Control Group no changes in behavior or EEG current source were 
observed. In the Experimental Group, immediately after treatment 
children showed behavioral and cognitive improvements, but current 
source analysis showed few modifications; however, 2 months after 
treatment many changes occurred: a decrease in current of frequencies 
within the theta band, mainly in left frontal and cingulate regions, and
 enhancement in current of frequencies within the alpha band, 
principally in the right temporal lobe and<br>right frontal regions, and
 of frequencies within the beta band, mainly in left temporal, right 
frontal and cingulate cortex regions. In conclusion, NFB is a possibly 
efficacious treatment for LD children with an abnormally high 
theta/alpha ratio in any lead. The changes observed in EEG current 
sources may reflect the neurophysiological bases of the improvement that
 children experienced in their behavioral and cognitive activities.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fernandez,
 T. et al, 2003.&nbsp; EEG and behavioral changes following 
neurofeedback treatment in learning disabled children.&nbsp; Clin. 
Electroencephalogr, 34(3): 145-152<br>Neurofeedback (NFB) is an operant 
conditioning procedure, by which the subject learns to control his/her 
EEG activity. On one hand, Learning Disabled (LD) children have higher 
values of theta EEG absolute and relative power than normal children, 
and on the other hand, it has been shown that minimum alpha absolute 
power is necessary for adequate performance. Ten LD children were 
selected with higher than normal ratios of theta to alpha absolute power
 (theta/alpha)<wbr>. The Test Of Variables of Attention (TOVA) was 
applied. Children were divided into two groups in order to maintain 
similar IQ values, TOVA values, socioeconomical status, and gender for 
each group. In the experimental group, NFB was applied in the region 
with highest ratio, triggering a sound each time the ratio fell below a 
threshold value. Noncontingent reinforcement was given to the other 
group. Twenty half-hour sessions were applied, at a rate of 2 per week. 
At the end of the 20 sessions,<br>TOVA, WISC and EEG were obtained. 
There was significant improvement in WISC performance in the 
experimental group that was not observed in the control group. EEG 
absolute power decreased in delta, theta, alpha and beta bands in the 
experimental group. Control children only showed a decrease in relative 
power in the delta band. All changes observed in the experimental group 
and not observed in the control group indicate better cognitive 
performance and the presence of greater EEG maturation in the 
experimental group, which suggests that changes were due not only to 
development but also to NFB treatment.<br>&nbsp;<br>Becerra, J.&nbsp;

 report is a 2-year follow-up to a previous study describing positive 
behavioral changes and a spurt of EEG maturation with theta/alpha 
neurofeedback (NFB) training in a group of Learning Disabled (LD) 
children. In a control paired group, treated with placebo, behavioral 
changes were not observed and the smaller maturational EEG changes 
observed were easily explained by increased age. Two years later, the 
EEG maturational lag in Control Group children increased, reaching 
abnormally high theta Relative Power values; the absence of positive 
behavioral changes continued and the neurological diagnosis remained LD.
 In contrast, after 2 years EEG maturation did continue in children who 
belonged to the Experimental Group with previous neurofeedback training;
 this was accompanied by positive behavioral changes, which were 
reflected in remission of LD symptoms.<br>&nbsp;<br>Leins, et al.&nbsp; 
2007.&nbsp; Neurofeedback for children with ADHD: a comparison of SCP 
and Theta/Beta protocols.&nbsp; Appl. Psychophysiol. Biofeedback, 32(2):
 73-88<br>Behavioral and cognitive improvements in children with ADHD have been consistently reported after neurofeedback-<wbr>treatment.
 However, neurofeedback has not been commonly accepted as a treatment 
for ADHD. This study addresses previous methodological shortcomings 
while comparing a neurofeedback-<wbr>training of Theta-Beta frequencies 
and training of slow cortical potentials (SCPs). The study aimed at 
answering (a) whether patients were able to demonstrate learning of 
cortical self-regulation, (b) if treatment leads to an improvement in 
cognition and behavior and (c) if the two experimental groups differ in 
cognitive and behavioral outcome variables. SCP participants were 
trained to produce positive and negative SCP-shifts while the Theta/Beta
 participants were trained to suppress Theta (4-8 Hz) while increasing 
Beta (12-20 Hz). Participants were blind to group assignment. Assessment
 included potentially confounding variables. Each group was comprised of
 19<br>children with ADHD (aged 8-13 years). The treatment procedure 
consisted of three phases of 10 sessions each. Both groups were able to 
intentionally regulate cortical activity and improved in attention and 
IQ. Parents and teachers reported significant behavioral and cognitive 
improvements. Clinical effects for both groups remained stable six 
months after treatment. Groups did not differ in behavioural or 
cognitive outcome.<br>&nbsp;<br>Egner et al, 2004.&nbsp; The effects of neurofeedback training on the spectral topography of the electroencephalogra<wbr>m. Clin. Neurophysiol.<wbr>,
 115(11): 2452-2460OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of EEG frequency
 band biofeedback (neurofeedback) training on spectral EEG topography, 
which is presumed to mediate cognitive-behaviour<wbr>al training 
effects. In order to assess the effect of commonly applied neurofeedback
 protocols on spectral EEG composition, two studies involving healthy 
participants were carried out. METHODS: In Experiment 1, subjects were 
trained on low beta (12-15 Hz), beta1 (15-18 Hz), and alpha/theta (8-11 
Hz/5-8 Hz) protocols, with spectral resting EEG assessed before and 
after training. The specific associations between learning indices of 
each individual training protocol and changes in absolute and relative 
spectral EEG topography was assessed by means of partial correlation 
analyses. Results of Experiment 1 served to generate hypotheses for<br>Experiment
 2, where subjects were randomly allocated to independent groups of low 
beta, beta1, and alpha/theta training. Spectral resting EEG measures 
were contrasted prior and subsequent to training within each group. 
RESULTS: Only few associations between particular protocols and spectral
 EEG changes were found to be consistent across the two studies, and 
these did not correspond to expectations based on the operant 
contingencies trained. Low-beta training was found to be somewhat 
associated with reduced post-training low-beta activity, while more 
reliably, alpha/theta training was associated with reduced relative 
frontal beta band activity. CONCLUSIONS: The results document that 
neurofeedback training of frequency components does affect spectral EEG 
topography in healthy subjects, but that these effects do not 
necessarily correspond to either the frequencies or the scalp locations 
addressed by the training contingencies. The association between<br>alpha/theta
 training and replicable reductions in frontal beta activity constitutes
 novel empirical neurophysiological evidence supporting inter alia the 
training's purported role in reducing agitation and anxiety. 
SIGNIFICANCE: These results underline the complexity of the neural 
dynamics involved EEG self-regulation and emphasize the need for 
empirical validation of predictable neurophysiological outcomes of 
training EEG biofeedback  </span><br>
