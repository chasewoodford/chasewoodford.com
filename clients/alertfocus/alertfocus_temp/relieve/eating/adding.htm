<p><span class="page"></span></p><p><b>Adding Biofeedback to your Practice</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biofeedback is well accepted as a safe 
method of stress reduction and is very easy to incorporate into a 
practice. Biofeedback instruments can be simple, flexible and powerful 
ways to bring calm to those with nervous disorders by training the 
nervous system in self-regulation. Biofeedback results can be charted 
precisely and can answer the call for evidence based practice. It may 
also help generate new revenue streams for your practice. Biofeedback of
 brainwaves (neurofeedback) has developed with advancing technology and 
has demonstrated broad clinical success. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neurofeedback clinicians report excellent 
outcomes with eating disorders and there is increasing research to back 
them up. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A biofeedback loop occurs when a person is 
engaged in interactive learning with a display of information from a 
biological signal generated by the nervous system. Learning to calm and 
stretch the nervous system enhances resilience and flexibility. 
Biofeedback offers patients improved anxiety management, an increased 
sense of physiological self-awareness, self-control and an improved 
level of hope that they can escape uncomfortable feelings in a healthy, 
non-destructive way. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three professional organizations that 
promote biofeedback research and practice are the Association for 
Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback (AAPB), the Biofeedback 
Certification Institute of America (BCIA) and the International Society 
for Neurofeedback and Research (ISNR). They have defined biofeedback 
this way:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">"Biofeedback is a process that 
enables an individual to learn how to change physiological activity for 
the purposes of improving health and performance. Precise instruments 
measure physiological activity such as brainwaves, heart function, 
breathing, muscle activity, and skin temperature. These instruments 
rapidly and accurately "feed back" information to the user. The 
presentation of this information – often in conjunction with changes in 
thinking, emotions, and behavior – supports desired physiological 
changes. Over time, these changes can endure without continued use of an
 instrument."</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biofeedback is an intervention technique 
that emerged from operant and respondent conditioning procedures in the 
1960s (Schwartz &amp; Olson, 1995). To date, considerable empirical 
evidence has shown that through operant learning, humans can gain 
moderate to strong volitional control over numerous internal 
physiological functions and the principal means of developing this 
control has been with consequences delivered via biofeedback (Allen, 
2007). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biofeedback is nothing mysterious. 
Biofeedback systems make unconscious behavior conscious. Once 
neurophysiology is visible and quantifiable it can be shaped and 
rewarded. In this age of evidence-based practices, biofeedback offers 
objective evidence of change, since numbers and graphs can be produced 
during each session. You can see improvement within and between 
sessions, e.g., reduced muscle tension, improved heart rate variability,
 increasing skin temperature and/or lower skin conductance (less sweaty 
hands). Biofeedback has long been recognized as a useful form of stress 
reduction (Lehrer, 2007) and has growing efficacy for a host of 
psychological problems (Oubrй, 2002), (Masterpasqua, Healey, 2003). 
Yucha, C. &amp; Gilbert, C. 2004 list efficacy ratings for numerous 
disorders including anxiety, attention deficit disorder, incontinence, 
headache, hypertension, alcoholism/substance abuse, arthritis, chronic 
pain, epilepsy, migraines, insomnia, traumatic brain injury, asthma, 
depressive disorders, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, post 
traumatic stress disorder, Raynaud's disease, tinnitus and eating 
disorders. In addition, biofeedback can enhance sports performance, 
personal growth and creativity in patients and non-patients alike.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a variety of ways to get training 
in biofeedback. Membership in the relevant professional organizations is
 an excellent way to learn more. Certification will be an eventual goal 
for some professionals. Licensed health care professionals may want to 
check with their professional organizations and boards about the scope 
of practice issue. The web sites of professional societies, 
manufacturers, and practitioners are rich sources of information. There 
are a dozen yahoo newsgroups devoted to biofeedback and neurofeedback. 
There are several paths of entry into biofeedback. The simplest is to 
start with "peripheral" biofeedback devices available to consumers, 
e.g., of muscle tension ("surface electromyography or sEMG), skin 
temperature, galvanic skin response (GSR) or skin conductance level 
(SCL) and/or heart rate variability (HRV). The cheapest way to begin is 
with a "stress thermometer" available on the internet for $20. It is a 
digital thermometer with a sensor at the end of a wire. You hold or tape
 the sensor on a finger tip, then relax. Within a few minutes most 
people will begin to see the temperature climb and this will be 
accompanied by a noticeable sense of relaxation. Fully relaxed, the skin
 temperature measured this way will be about 94 degrees. You can 
validate just how relaxing imagery, meditation, pleasant music or 
massage actually is by seeing this type of direct physiological evidence
 of the relaxation response (Benson 2000).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heart rate variability biofeedback devices 
cost $160 - $300. HRV is a powerful way to balance the autonomic nervous
 system by synchronizing breathing with respiratory sinus arrhythmia. At
 a persons resonant breathing frequency the fastest heart rate will be 
at full inhalation and the slowest heart rate will at the full 
exhalation (Leher, 2006). Muscle tension devices start at about $475. 
With very little training, most anyone can teach their clients very 
quickly (6 sessions or less) how to find a relaxed posture sitting and 
standing, how to let go of chronic sympathetic activation of the "fight 
or flight" response and how to initiate the relaxation response of the 
parasympathetic "rest and digest" system. </p>
<p><b>Neurofeedback</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neurofeedback (sometimes called EEG 
biofeedback or neurotherapy) is a form of biofeedback that monitors and 
feeds back neurological information usually in a multimedia display. The
 ISNR publishes the Journal of Neurotherapy, which focuses exclusively 
on research with neurofeedback and quantitative EEG. There is a 
comprehensive bibliography of disorders treated by neurofeedback on the <a href="http://www.isnr.org/">www.ISNR.org</a> website. With 2 or 3 lines per citation and 45 categories the document is currently running to 30 pages (Hammond, 2008).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not published is a controlled outcome study 
at a residential treatment center where 120 patients were administered 
psychological and EEG tests (Smith, Sams, Sherlin, ISNR Annual 
Conference, 2006). A variety of neurofeedback approaches were added to 
the standard treatment regimen for 21 anorexic and 54 bulimic patients. 
All neurofeedback approaches were successful compared to a traditional 
treatment control group. </p>
<p><b><u>Results</u></b></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Significant decrease in Beck 
Depression Inventory-2 scores, neuroticism scores, and all Eating 
Disorders Inventory-2 scores. <br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Significant increase in extroversion scores.<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MMPI-2 changes reveal a reduction in symptoms associated with distress.<br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduction in dosage of psychiatric medications ranged between 25% and 65%. <br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anorexics gained weight significantly. Bulimics lost 3 lbs/month during treatment.</p>
<p><b><u>Follow-up</u></b></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 63 of the original 75 subjects responded to 6-month follow-up.<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 80-100% reduction in depression on Beck Depression Inventory.<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depression reduction was the key factor in sustained success. <br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Weight changes continued in the proper direction. Anorexics gained 
about 1 lb per week. Overweight bulimics lost about 3 lbs per month.<br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 65% are doing well in recovery. 80% have had some resurgence of symptoms.<br>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Maintenance of preferred weight direction was better for anorexics 
(p&gt;.05) than for bulimics (p&gt;.08), and third for overweight.<br>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Overall, outcomes for neurofeedback group were twice as strong as the 
traditional treatment controls. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not just one way to do 
neurofeedback. Instead there are several camps that have each developed 
diverse yet successful approaches. Neurofeedback is done by some in a 
training model with the goal to optimize neurological functioning in 
people with or without symptoms. Others prefer a practice model that 
uses subjective and/or objective assessments such as a QEEG brain map to
 "target" neurofeedback training. For example, people with high anxiety,
 physical tension and incessant thinking frequently have excessive high 
frequency "beta" brainwave activity over the central sensorimotor and 
parietal association cortices. And there are several other approaches to
 the same case such as focusing on inter-site coherence, reducing 
turbulence of the EEG or training up regional cerebral blood flow with 
hemoencephalography (HEG). Other popular approaches to training will 
boost alertness, e.g., less frontal/central theta with more mid-range 
beta power or training will aim for a more relaxed state, e.g., more 
sensorimotor rhythm or more posterior alpha rhythm eyes closed. 
Neurofeedback equipment is generally more powerful, complex and 
expensive than peripheral biofeedback. Neurofeedback equipment can cost 
$1100 - $5000+. Most manufacturers have a version of their systems for 
clients to train at home under clinical supervision. </p>
<p><b>Take Home Points</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With careful observation of what is really 
going on psychophysiologically, you can help people take charge of 
themselves. With this comes an increasing sense of self-efficacy and a 
belief in the controllability of previously uncontrollable emotional 
states. As this happens, much of the out-of-control panic feelings 
patients have will dissipate. Depression begins to lift rapidly and 
enduringly as patients realize there is actually something they 
personally can do to improve the way they feel and the way they operate 
their nervous system. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your patients can benefit from learning to 
lower their anxiety and improve their ability to drop themselves at will
 into an emotionally and physically relaxed, but mentally alert and 
focused state. This is easy enough to promote with a variety of 
biofeedback methods, ranging from peripheral feedback of muscle tension 
and autonomic indicators to various aspects of the brain’s electrical 
activity. A final excellent reason to add biofeedback to your practice 
is that patients volunteer to stay in treatment longer when 
neurofeedback is offered to them (Scott et al. 2005). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historically, biofeedback efficacy has been 
recognized for some decades now, but it has been trivialized as 
relaxation training when in fact it offers a powerful pathway for 
enhanced self-regulatory status of the whole nervous system. This has 
particular import for conditions with a significant neurophysiological 
component that impedes recovery by conventional therapeutic methods. The
 role of biofeedback in recovery is particularly compelling when the 
dysregulation manifests in so many different systems, as is the case in 
eating disorders and in addictions, (Trocki, 2007). </p>
