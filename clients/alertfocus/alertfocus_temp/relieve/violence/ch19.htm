<p><strong>Chapter 19 – Prisons, Drugs, and Special Education</strong></p>
<p>We have a massive problem in the United States with our inability to 
reduce our prison population and drug abuse problem. Treatment 
interventions are, by and large, ineffective with these groups.</p>
<p><strong>Size of the Problem</strong></p>
<p>There were 2,268,000 people behind bars in the US in 2004, up1.9% 
from 2003.With an incarceration rate of 724 per 100,000 inhabitants, the
 United States is the unchallenged world leader in both raw numbers and 
imprisonment per capita.</p>
<p>With a global prison population estimated at nine million, the 
USaccounts for about one-quarter of all prisoners on the planet. The 
estimated U.S. population is 297,731,005 (population clock) or 5% of the
 world population, which is 6,480,917,568 and incarcerates 24% of the 
world’s prison population.</p>
<p>In terms of raw numbers, only China, with almost four times 
thepopulation of the US, comes close, with about 1.5 million prisoners. 
Ourcloser competitors in incarceration rates are Russia (638 per 
100,000) andBelarus (554), according to the British government’s World 
Prison PopulationReport. The Federal Bureau of Prisons is now the 
largest prison systemin the land, with 180,000 inmates, followed by 
Texas (168,000), California(167,000), and Florida (86,000). The federal 
system is now at 40% overcapacity. (Profile of Jail Inmates, 2002) 
(State Prison Expenditures, 1996)</p>
<p><strong>Drugs</strong></p>
<p>Criminal behavior and drug abuse behavior overlap considerably.The 
total number of people doing time for drugs in the United States in2003 
exceeded 530,000, according to numbers from the Bureau of 
JusticeStatistics (Feature, 2005). People sentenced for drug crimes 
accounted for21% of state prisoners and 55% of federal prisoners.Drug 
abuse has a great economic impact on society-an estimated$67 billion per
 year. This figure includes costs related to crime, medicalcare, drug 
abuse treatment, social welfare programs, and time lost fromwork. 
Treatment of drug abuse can reduce those costs. Studies have shownthat 
from $4 to $7 are saved for every dollar spent on treatment. It costs 
approximately $3,600 per month to leave a drug abuser untreated in the 
community, and incarceration costs approximately $3,300 per month. In 
contrast, methadone maintenance therapy costs about $290 per month (NIDA
 info facts).</p>
<p><strong>LD/ED/Drop outs </strong></p>
<p>The Coalition for Juvenile Justice (CJJ) report shows that between 
70and 87 percent of incarcerated youth suffer from learning disabilities
 (LD)or emotional disabilities (ED) that interfere with their education.
 Moreover,youth that drop out of school are three and a half times more 
likely to bearrested than high school graduates. In the adult criminal 
system, 82 percentof prison inmates dropped out of high school. (Leahy, 
2001)Traumatic brain injuries have been correlated with violent 
behavioraltendencies like those observed in the behavioral topography of
 perpetratorsof serial homicides. (Lewis et al., 1986). A 1986 study 
examinedthe neurological histories of fifteen death row inmates and 
found that everymember of the experimental population had experienced 
severe head injuryprior to incarceration (Lewis et al., 1986). Galski et
 al. (1989) also documented the role of previous traumatic brain 
injuries in the violent offender. Brain damage in utero and in early 
childhood has been correlated with increased tendencies toward both 
youth and adult violence (Raine et al, 1997) (Prothow-Smith and Spivak, 
1999)</p>
<p><strong>Costs of Prisons</strong> </p>
<p>As the US has the largest prison business in the world, the costs 
associated with the business are also large. In its first analysis of 
state prison expenditures since 1990, the federal government’s Bureau of
 Justice Statistics reports that state correctional costs rose from $12 
billion in 1990to $22 billion in 1996, an 83 percent increase. The state
 prison populationrose 52 percent during the same time period. Federal 
prison expendituresrose 160% from $946 million in 1990 to $2.5 billion 
in 1996, an averageof about 17% a year. Ninety-six percent of the state 
expenditures were forsalaries, wages, benefits and other operating 
expenses. The total operatingper inmate cost rose from $16,300 in 1984, 
to $18,400 in 1990 to $20,100(state inmates) and $23,500 (Federal 
inmates) in 1996. (Stephan, 1996)</p>
<p>On a per capita basis, it costs every man, woman and child in 
thecountry $103 to run state prisons in 1996, up from $53 per person in 
1985.California had the largest state prison expenditure in 1996, 
spending $3billion and North Dakota had the smallest, $10.7 million. The
 figures comefrom an analysis of the 1996 Survey of Government Finances,
 conducted bythe U.S. Bureau of the Census. Bureau of Justice Statistics
 finance specialists contacted state budget and corrections officials to
 ensure the numbers were accurate and then made considerable corrections
 to the dataIn conclusion, the our drug and special education problems 
continueto grow in tandem with the size and cost of our prison 
population.</p>
<p><strong>Costs to Victims</strong></p>
<p>The costs of these crimes go beyond those to society’s prison 
costsand the perpetrator’s jail time. Crime victims in 1992 lost $17.6 
billion indirect costs, according to the National Crime Victimization 
Survey. Thesecosts included losses from property theft or damage, cash 
losses, medicalexpenses, and amount of pay lost because of injury or 
activities related tothe crime. The crimes included in this figure are 
rape, robbery, assault,personal and household theft, burglary, and motor
 vehicle theft. Crimesinclude attempts as well as completed offenses. 
(Klaus, 1994)</p>
<p><strong>Treatment – How has our society attempted to deal with these problems?</strong></p>
<p>Due to the overlapping problem of criminal behavior and drug 
abuse,some studies have examined both of these behaviors following 
treatment.</p>
<p>The drug rehabilitation industry has been looking for effective 
solutions for decades. Substance Abuse and America’s Prison Population 
revealed that 80 percent of the men and women behind bars in the U.S. 
wereseriously involved with drugs and alcohol. That year, states spent 
nearly $30billion on the adult corrections system, $24.1 billion of 
which was spent onsubstance-involved offenders making substance abuse 
the number one contributor to crime in America.</p>
<p>The state of Texas released a report in 2005 that examined the 
recidivism rate among its prisoners during 2000 and 2001. They found 
anaverage recidivism rate of about 30%, with property (35%) and drug 
offenders (31%) having the highest rates followed by individuals 
initiallyconvicted of violent offenses (23%). The recidivism rate among 
other statesthat included California (2000- 60.5 %), Colorado 
(1999-47%), Pennsylvania(2000- 46%) and a national norm of 51% (1994). 
The Texas studyalso indicated that juveniles had a higher recidivism 
rate (about 51%). Thereport did not indicate whether any treatment was 
involved. Therefore, anyintervention must be compared to the naturally 
occurring recidivism ratewithout treatment. (Statewide Criminal Justice 
Recidivism rates and revocation rates, 2005)</p>
<p><strong>DTAP - Residential/Therapy – Alcoholism</strong> </p>
<p>The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA)conducted a
 five-year research study (2/2003) through Columbia Universityon the 
Drug Treatment Alternative-to-Prison (DTAP) Program and foundthat 
positive results were achieved at about half the cost of 
incarceration.(DTAP, 2003)</p>
<p>The DTAP program provides 15 to 24 months of residential 
drugtreatment, vocational training, and social and mental health 
services to drug addicted, nonviolent repeat offenders who face 
mandatory punishment underNew York State’s second felony offender law. 
Participants are abusers of heroin, crack and powder cocaine, among 
other substances. They plead guilty to a felony, thereby ensuring a 
mandatory prison sentence if theyabscond from the program. Sentencing is
 deferred upon program participation; if participants complete the 
program, their guilty plea is withdrawn and the charges dismissed.</p>
<p>The five-year CASA evaluation found that participants who 
completedthe program and graduated were 33 percent less likely to be 
rearrested,45 percent less likely to be reconvicted, and 87 percent less
 likely toreturn to prison than the comparable prison group.</p>
<p>DTAP graduates were three and one half times more likely to 
beemployed after graduation than before their arrest. Before their 
arrest, 26percent were working either part-time or full-time. Following 
successfulcompletion of the program, 92 percent had found employment.</p>
<p>DTAP participants remain in treatment six times longer than 
individuals in other long-term residential treatment (a median of 17.8 
monthscompared to three months). Retention rates are important because 
the longer an individual stays in treatment, the greater their chance of
 maintaining sobriety.</p>
<p>These results are achieved at about half the cost of 
incarceration.The average cost for each DTAP participant of residential 
drug treatment,vocational training, and support services was $32,975, 
compared to an average cost of $64,338 for the time spent in prison for 
DTAP participants who dropped out.</p>
<p><strong>Psychotherapy – Individual / Group – Drugs and Criminal behavior</strong></p>
<p>A review of treatment outcomes for drug addiction and criminalitywas 
reported by Simpson et al. (2002). Interviews were conducted at1 and 5 
years after treatment for 708 subjects (from 45 programs in 8 cities)who
 met DSM-III-R criteria for cocaine dependence when admitted 
in1991-1993. Primary outcome measures included drug use and 
criminality.Self-reported cocaine use showed high overall agreement with
 urine (79%agreement) and hair (80% agreement) toxicology analyses. The 
results indicated that half (52%) had relapses to drug use: 23% to 
“weekly” cocaineuse; 19% to “occasional” cocaine; 10% to “other drugs”.</p>
<p>Additional conclusions noted that the percent of illegal activity 
declined from 40% before the intake for program participation to 25% in 
year 5 follow-up after discharge from the program (up slightly from 16% 
in year 1). The percent arrests in the past year dropped from 34% before
 the programintake to 18% in year 5 follow-up (down slightly from 22% in
 year 1).The group that received less treatment (i.e. “low treatment”) 
did not fare aswell. Low treatment usually meant less than 3-months of 
treatment – considered the minimum “threshold” for an effective length 
of stay. In addition, poorer long-term outcomes were related to higher 
problem severity at treatment admission and less treatment.</p>
<p>We need to look at these numbers for a moment to see exactly whatthe 
result of the treatment was. If illegal activity was at the 40% figure 
priorthe treatment, then 60% of the participants had stopped committing 
illegalactivity, a “spontaneous cure”. If the treatment program resulted
 in a posttreatment rate of illegal activity at year 1 of 16%, then the 
program was effective in reducing illegal activity by another 24%. Thus,
 of the 40% who were still committing illegal activity, 60% (24/40) were
 “cured” of theirillegal activities at the one year post treatment time 
assessment. Employingthis approach to the data results in a treatment 
effectiveness value of 70%for cocaine abuse, 73% for heroin abuse, 73% 
for alcohol abuse, and 35%for any arrests (which is not the same as a 
recidivism number). Thus the“recidivism” rate for drug abuse was about 
30% and for criminal activitybetween 40% (illegal activity) and 65% 
(arrest) if the person was engagedin the program.</p>
<p><strong>EEG Biofeedback – Neurotherapy and Criminal Behavior Initial Discovery</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Von Helsheimer and Doug Quirk reported between 1970-1995 ona 
series of fascinating observations and research results that are 
particularlyrelevant to the prison population (Quirk, 1995, Quirk &amp; 
Von Helsheimer).Mr. Quirk was interested in the prison population. As a 
psychologist he hadlearned to administer the Bender-Gestalt test which 
requires the subject tocopy geometric designs. A variant of this test is
 the Diagnostic DifferentialTest (DDT).</p>
<p>One of the neurologists on staff where Mr. Quirk worked gave him 
alist of 10 patients whose serial EEGs eventually demonstrated epilepsy 
butwho did not have seizures. He was asked what test to use to figure 
out howto recognize them more reliably than with the EEG. Doug found a 
file intowhich he had put the DDT’s those individuals’ had taken and 
found thoseparticular DDT’s as uninterpretable.</p>
<p>He had a casual conversation with a psychologist who told him ofsome 
work he had been doing with pigeons demonstrating that when anablation 
was made in the region of the brain’s septum the pigeons that hadbeen 
trained to respond to angular signs were post operation unable to 
differentiate the angles from curves. The performance of his 10 puzzling
 patients on the DDT indicated that they couldn’t handle angles as well 
as they could handle curves. So Quirk decided that he had found an 
indicator ofdeep diencephalic epilepsy. The first 70 patients he found 
with this sign onthe DDT were all diagnosed by a neurologist as 
epileptic. All but one hadtypical seizure spindles on the EEG.</p>
<p>Quirk applied the DDT to a large number of arsonists, assaultists 
andrapists. Forty per cent of the serious arsonists, 30% of the 
assaultists, and25% of the rapists demonstrated the sub-ictal sign on 
the DDT. This lastgroup, the rapists with anomalous DDT performance, 
also demonstratedvisible anomalies of the temporal lobe in CAT scans.</p>
<p>By way of contrast, fewer than 2% of the remaining ‘garden 
varieties’of less dangerous offenders exhibited this deep-brain 
epileptic syndrome.In several other studies we found that there was a 
consistent andstrong relationship between strong emotional reactivity or
 weak emotionalcontrol and dangerous criminal actions.</p>
<p><strong>Sub-ictal Seizures</strong></p>
<p>Some epilepsies whose focus lies in the deep recesses of the old 
brain are variously referred to as partial seizures with complex 
symptomatology (PSCS) or “complex partial seizures”. These are 
non-convulsive seizures, paroxysmal events, sub-ictal states, or seizure
 equivalents. The behaviors associated with these sub-ictal states tend 
to distract the observer because they are intense, gruesome, 
unappetizing, and usually criminal activities. If the epileptic 
discharge in these seizures involves the Olds and Milner ‘drive centre’,
 the person may exhibit uncontrolled paroxysms of rage, sexual drive, 
hunger, satiety, alcohol use, or other excitant automatisms such as fire
 setting. The individual may seem perfectly normal in just a few seconds
 after the explosion of aberrant behavior. There is a subclass of 
criminal which is floridly emotional and whose emotionality is almost 
always associated with grotesque and extreme acting out.</p>
<p>The most common prodrome in deep-brain complex partial seizuresseems 
to be heightened intensity of emotional arousal -- perhaps sometimesdue 
to associated activation of the Olds and Milner ‘drive centre’. The 
difficulty encountered by most people in using strong emotional arousal 
as acue for behavior is that emotional arousal tends to distract 
attention fromconscious cortical self-regulatory habits. High emotional 
intensity tends todisengage the subject from such moderating habits. 
Distracted attention anddisengagement is intensified by alcohol and by 
recreational and medicaldrugs, all of which are often involved in scenes
 of intense emotionality. Itis generally agreed that some deep-brain 
complex partial seizures are facilitated by alcohol ingestion.</p>
<p><strong>Developing the intervention</strong></p>
<p>In 1970 Quirk went to a meeting in Boston and heard Barry Stermantalk
 about his work with cats and human epileptics. Dr. Sternman was 
employing the sensori-motor rhythm (SMR) frequency (12-15 Hertz) to 
successfully inhibit seizure activity in cats. He was training the 13 
Hertz range along the Fissure of Roland (Sensorimotor Strip or sulcus 
centralis – top central portion of head) which resulted in resistance to
 epileptic seizure -even that produced by toxins such as hydrazine (an 
normally infallible producer of seizures of fatal intensity). The 
amplitude of 13 Hz is notoriouslysmall in epileptics over the Rolandic 
Fissure.</p>
<p>Quirk completed two preliminary studies of recidivism among 
OntarioCorrectional Institute felons who had been discharged. He 
compared55 pairs of high-risk felons, half of whom were treated by 
temperature biofeedback, a modified GSR technique called SCARS, and by 
Sterman’s EEG method, and half of whom received only counseling. These 
felons received 33 half-hour sessions of training. These violent felons 
demonstrated the sub-ictal pattern on the DDT (viz., they didn’t handle 
visual angles as wellas visual curves) and on the EEG. The treatment of 
the 55 felons includedvolunteer administered temperature biofeedback 
training, SCARS GSRtraining, and EEG training of the sensorimotor rhythm
 at C-3 and C-4 asdescribed by Sterman. Subsequently, he trained another
 group of 55 pairs offelons In the typical case, the percent of the time
 in which this SMR activityoccurred tended to average around 10% during 
the first few half-hour trainingsessions, and to rise to 45% to 55% 
during the last training sessions.</p>
<p>Two years after his initial study of 55 pairs of felons 22 or 40% of 
thetreated felons had been arrested again. Two years after the second 
study of55 pairs of felons 11 or 20% of the treated felons had been 
rearrested. Thisrate of recidivism compared to 85% and 65% rearrested 
among the matchedfelons who were not treated by biofeedback. In other 
words, 60% and 80%of the treated felons were still free, while only 15% 
and 35% of the untreatedfelons had managed to remain outside of prison.</p>
<p>The justice system records of the offenders accepted into this 
biofeedback treatment program were reviewed an average of a year and a 
half after release from their treatment sentences. Of the 17 offenders 
who received 0 to 4 half-hour training sessions (i.e., essentially no 
treatment), 65% had been re-convicted of criminal offenses. Of the 10 
who had received 34 or more half-hour training sessions, only 2 or 20% 
had been re-convictedof criminal offenses. Intermediate amounts of 
training were found to be associated with intermediate recidivism rates.
 Among these subjects, neitherfollow-up interval nor age were related to
 recidivism rates.</p>
<p>Overall, from 1970 through 1995, Mr. Quirk trained 2776 felons bythis
 combined method (temperature, GSR, and EEG). Of those trained, 15%were 
rearrested in the 3 years following release. This compares well to 
therange of rearrest in studies summarized by Alter et al (1996) - 42 % 
to 78%.In a series of reports to corrections officials, Mr. Quirk 
indicated that thethree-year recidivism rate from the biofeedback (using
 these techniques)had never been more than 45%, and in some groups had 
fallen to 15%.Overall, the rate of recidivism was consistently close to 
15%.</p>
<p>The common rate of recidivism in correctional institutions in 
theUnited States was generally, at the time, believed to be 98% within 
twoyears of discharge. To put the numbers in a different perspective, 
prisonswere so bad that it could be said that we were failing to 
criminalize only2% of the juvenile population enrolled in our higher 
institutions of learning(correctional institutes). (Quirk, 1995)</p>
<p>The Texas report indicated that, presently, in a normal prison 
population we can expect about a 51% recidivism rate presently without 
anyform of intervention.</p>
<p>The effectiveness, time and cost issues for these intervention 
methodsare summarized in Table 22 and compared to the national norm. 
Therefore,any intervention must be considered with reference to this 
base rate.An examination of the table quickly reveals that the EEG 
biofeedback approach is clearly the more effective mode of treatment for
 this condition, aswell as being the least expensive.</p>
<p><strong>EEG Biofeedback and Seizure Activity</strong></p>
<p>EEG biofeedback originally developed out of the discoveries of 
B.Sterman in the application of the approach to inhibit seizure 
activity. It wasfound as early as 1969 that after training for enhanced 
SMR (12-15 Hz)rhythm in cats, the threshold for seizure onset was 
increased for chemicallyinduced seizures (Fairchild, 1974, Sterman, 
1976). Sterman and hisassociates (Sterman &amp; Friar, 1972; Sterman et 
al., 1974) found by trainingepileptics to enhance the human EEG 
sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) of 12-15Hertz (Hz) that their seizure 
management could be improved. Sterman etal. (1974) achieved an average 
66% reduction in seizure incidence in fourepileptics using SMR 
enhancement training in combination with inhibitionof excessive 
slow-wave activity in the 6-9 Hz regime. Lubar and Bahler(1976) found 
similar results when they trained epileptics to enhance theSMR frequency
 and suppress the theta (4-7 Hz) slow wave frequency. Wyler’s and 
Finley’s studies were the first to include such pseudo-conditioning and 
control periods (Wyler, 1976; Finley, 1976). Such sham training was also
 provided in a more exhaustive, double-blind study (neither the 
experimenter nor the patient was aware of the contingency of reward) 
undertaken by Lubar, et al. in 1981. Five of 8 patients exhibited 
seizure reduction with respect to baseline, the reduction being 35% for 
the entire group. Since the original research in this area, the evidence
 for the application of the technology to seizure activity has continued
 to amass as a reliable intervention method for seizure reduction. 
(Sterman, 2000) Alternateprotocols to address the seizure problem have 
been employed by Walker &amp;Kozlowski (2005) who reported a 100% 
reduction in seizure activity in agroup of patients.</p>
<p>It has been documented that about 20% of the patients with 
epilepsymay exhibit ADHD symptoms. (Tan &amp; Appelton, 2005). 
Electroencephalography has also been reported to be abnormal in children
 with ADHD, some showing epileptiform activity. The reported incidence 
ranges from 6.1% of 476 of children with ADHD (compared to 3.5% of 3726,
 normal, school age children) 18 to 30.1% of 176 children with ADHD.As 
EEG seizure activity (not necessarily behavioral seizure activity)is 
part of the picture in the learning disabled and ADHD population, 
theability of the intervention approach is self evident. </p>
