<P>As we all well know, addictions are very difficult to treat and</P>
<P>relapse rates are very high. Furthermore the individuals with</P>
<P>the best outcomes are likely to be white, of high socioeconomic</P>
<P>status (SES) better educated, addicted to a single drug, or in a socially</P>
<P>stable living situation. However over the past two decades</P>
<P>a new kind of adjunct therapy for addictions has emerged that</P>
<P>is ideally suited for delivery within treatment settings by midlevel</P>
<P>licensed professionals such as nurses, socialworkers, counselors,</P>
<P>or physical therapists. This is a treatment approach that</P>
<P>has shown strong, positive results in long term follow-ups but</P>
<P>the spread has been glacially slow. Given the strong positive</P>
<P>findings it almost seems as though there is a sort of a conspiracy</P>
<P>keeping this treatment from being used.</P>
<P>Neurofeedback (also known as Neurotherapy, EEG biofeedback</P>
<P>or brainwave training) has been found to be highly effective</P>
<P>in maintaining remission status in some of the most intractable</P>
<P>populations when used in combination with typical treatment </P>
<P>approaches (Trudeau, 2005). Neurofeedback is a form of biofeedback</P>
<P>where a therapist trains a person to increase or decrease</P>
<P>certain brainwave frequencies using electroencephalographic</P>
<P>measures taken from electrodes attached to specific sites on the</P>
<P>scalp. It has been used for substance abuse, attention deficit disorder</P>
<P>(ADD), seizure disorders, traumatic brain injuries (TBI),</P>
<P>and many other conditions marked by EEG abnormalities. The</P>
<P>main professional organization for neurofeedback, the International</P>
<P>Society for Neuronal Regulation, keeps an up-to-date bibliography</P>
<P>of published studies on their web site (www.isnr.org).</P>
<P>Most commonly, neurofeedback is administered by using a</P>
<P>combination of hardware, software, and computer connections.</P>
<P>Information is transmitted from the electrode sites to an encoder</P>
<P>device, which in turn transmits it to the computer to give the person</P>
<P>feedback (a sound and/or a visual signal) indicating whether</P>
<P>they are accomplishing the goals of the task. For instance, for</P>
<P>the standard Peniston/Kulkosky protocol (more about this later)</P>
<P>an electrode might be placed at a specific occipital lobe site</P>
<P>(O1 using the 10-20 system) and the individual is trained to</P>
<P>increase alpha and theta brainwaves to induce a profound relaxation</P>
<P>effect that occurs when the theta amplitude crosses over</P>
<P>(or becomes higher) than the alpha amplitude. There are protocols</P>
<P>other than alpha-theta and many different neurofeedback</P>
<P>devices. These devices use a range of different feedback techniques</P>
<P>such as photic stimulation (light feedback), electromagnetic</P>
<P>stimulation, or the measure of blood oxygenation (HEG);</P>
<P>but their intent is the same: to modify and restore healthy brain</P>
<P>functioning. However, since none of these other techniques have</P>
<P>any published studies on substance dependent or abusing populations,</P>
<P>they will not be addressed here.</P>
<P>One of the first published studies of substance abuse treatment</P>
<P>and neurofeedback was presented in 1989 in the journal,</P>
<P><I>Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research </I>(Peniston &amp;</P>
<P>Kulkosky, 1989). This was a study done at a Veteran’s Administration</P>
<P>hospital in Colorado after Peniston had been trained in</P>
<P>neurofeedback and biofeedback at the Menninger Institute. The</P>
<P>study included 30 men, 20 of them severe alcoholics who had</P>
<P>a minimum of four prior admissions for treatment and an average</P>
<P>of more than 20 years of dependence. Ten men constituted</P>
<P>a non-alcoholic control. Details of the specific protocol can be</P>
<P>found in the article.</P>
<P>In the short-term follow-up immediately at the end of the</P>
<P>training it was found that the experimental group could significantly</P>
<P>increase alpha and theta relative to the control groups and</P>
<P>was significantly lower on depression scores as measured by</P>
<P>the Beck Depression Inventory (Peniston &amp; Kulkosky, 1989).</P>
<P>A separate analysis of the same data (Peniston &amp; Kulkosky,</P>
<P>1990) for the experimental and control groups showed significant</P>
<P>positive changes on the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory</P>
<P>(MCMI) and the Sixteen Personality Factor questionnaire</P>
<P>(16PF). In a follow-up done 13 months later it was found that</P>
<P>eight of the ten men in the experimental group were still in remission</P>
<P>compared to only two in the control group. The results</P>
<P>were so startling that the investigators as well as a staff member</P>
<P>of the Menninger Institute personally validated the outcomes by</P>
<P>speaking with the subjects and their family members. Follow-ups</P>
<P>have been periodically conducted with the experimental group</P>
<P>and remission rates continue to be high.</P>
<P>Since that time there have been a number of other published</P>
<P>studies and still more presented at conferences. Saxby</P>
<P>and Peniston (1995) did an alpha-theta intervention with 14 alcoholics</P>
<P>(both men and women with an average of 17 years</P>
<P>alcohol dependence combined with depressive symptoms). At</P>
<P>the 21-month follow-up point, 13 of these 14 individuals remained</P>
<P>in remission according to self-report and the report of</P>
<P>collaterals. Kelley (1997) treated a group of 19 Navaho Indians</P>
<P>with a program based on alpha-theta which incorporated culturally</P>
<P>specific aspects such as a “singer” medicine man/therapist</P>
<P>who provided encouragement, blessings, purification and other</P>
<P>guidance. Three years later the follow-up found 21% in full</P>
<P>remission and 63% in partial remission (e.g., had experienced</P>
<P>some infrequent, problem-free relapses and a few who had gone</P>
<P>to normal drinking with no binges).</P>
<P>Taub et al. (1994) did a study with three different intervention</P>
<P>arms compared to a regular treatment group. The added interventions</P>
<P>included transcendental meditation, EMG (muscle)</P>
<P>biofeedback, and “neurotherapy.” The first two groups had the</P>
<P>best outcomes at the one year point. However, what Taub called</P>
<P>“neurotherapy” was really a form of cranial electrostimulation</P>
<P>(CES) and not neurofeedback.</P>
<P>Recently two larger studies were done within residential treatment</P>
<P>programs with populations of severe poly-drug users, most</P>
<P>of whom were minorities and/or homeless. Scott et al. (2005)</P>
<P>conducted a study on a polydrug population in long-term residential</P>
<P>treatment at Cri-Help in Los Angeles. The investigators</P>
<P>used a modified version of the Peniston/Kulkosky protocol that</P>
<P>included a preliminary series of SMR (sensory motor rhythm</P>
<P>13-15 Hz) and beta training (15-18 Hz) instead of temperature</P>
<P>training. These sessions were included because many people</P>
<P>with substance abuse are comorbid forADDand these frequency</P>
<P>ranges tend to have lower amplitude than they should. They used</P>
<P>the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA; Greenberg, 1992) to</P>
<P>assess whether attention parameters had normalized (it took an</P>
<P>average of 13 sessions) and this was then followed by 30 alphatheta</P>
<P>sessions. The follow-up found that77%of the experimental</P>
<P>group were in remission a year later compared to only 44% of</P>
<P>the controls. A non-published follow-up at three years showed</P>
<P>that the rates of remission had been sustained whereas the control</P>
<P>group had more relapses. Burkett and colleagues (Burkett,</P>
<P>2006; Burkett, Cummins, Dickson, &amp; Skolnick, 2005) used a</P>
<P>similar training protocol for a crack/cocaine abusing population,</P>
<P>the majority of whom were homeless and unemployed on</P>
<P>treatment entry. At the 12-month point following treatment 49%</P>
<P>were in complete remission and an additional 30% had used cocaine</P>
<P>fewer than four times. Ninety-two percent had maintained</P>
<P>a regular residence (compared to 40% at entry) and 91% were</P>
<P>employed (compared to 17% prior to entry). There was no control</P>
<P>group.</P>
<P>In addition to reviewing published studies for this article,</P>
<P>personal interviews were done with numerous neurofeedback</P>
<P>practitioners who have worked with substance abusers. For instance</P>
<P>the head of the Texas Commision on Alcohol and Drug</P>
<P>Abuse was dismayed at the cost of traditional treatment services</P>
<P>that still resulted in high relapse rates. He became interested</P>
<P>in neurofeedback and funded several programs that were successful</P>
<P>but only one of them has been published (Burkett et al.,</P>
<P>2005). Most individual clinicians with private pay patients or</P>
<P>those in private institutions report successes equal to the published</P>
<P>reports, particularly when the therapy is an adjunct to a</P>
<P>formal treatment program or AA/NA.</P>
<P>There have been some negative findings or failures to replicate</P>
<P>but none of them published. For instance Grapp et al. (1998)</P>
<P>found that depression rates decreased in a PTSD sample but</P>
<P>other outcomes were no where near as dramatic as Peniston’s.</P>
<P>Graap also critiqued Peniston’s published reports as having reporting</P>
<P>flaws to which Peniston replied (Graap&amp;Freides, 1998;</P>
<P>Peniston, 1998). The most notable failure was presented by</P>
<P>Fahrion (2002) about a study where alpha-theta training was</P>
<P>used with a large population of prisoners. The two-year followup</P>
<P>of over 500 showed only small differences between the experimental</P>
<P>and control groups. However the Fahrion protocol</P>
<P>differed substantially from the original Peniston/Kulkosky one</P>
<P>because it was done in groups of up to ten participants plugged</P>
<P>into the same, somewhat primitive, instrument. Subgroup analysis</P>
<P>revealed that the stimulant user group was particularly resistant</P>
<P>to change.</P>
<P>In addition, the published studies have weaknesses relative</P>
<P>to NIH-funded research. Notably, most of the studies have problems</P>
<P>with follow-up since the treatment entities have self-funded</P>
<P>the research and have tried to track highly mobile and dysfunctional</P>
<P>populations with inadequate resources (from my personal</P>
<P>experience follow-up for a difficult population usually costs</P>
<P>about $500 per case per interview point). In particular it is hard</P>
<P>to track controls and early drop-outs since they are more likely</P>
<P>to have higher severity levels. Thus the success rates often are</P>
<P>based on the clients the researchers are able to find. This creates</P>
<P>problems when the researchers attempt to get their work published</P>
<P>in prestigious and high impact journals. Still, the success</P>
<P>rates are remarkable and would stand against other treatment</P>
<P>approaches even if one were to factor in the lost-to-follow-up</P>
<P>groups.</P>
<P>Thus published studies, conference presentations, and</P>
<P>anecdotal reports have shown neurofeedback to be efficacious</P>
<P>for substance abuse as well as co-occurance of depression,</P>
<P>ADD, changes in personality profile, and the maintenance</P>
<P>of a stable lifestyle. Yet the approach is not widely used nor</P>
<P>has NIH or foundation funding been available to examine the</P>
<P>mechanisms that might explain, further validate, and refine this</P>
<P>therapeutic approach. There are only a few dozen treatment</P>
<P>programs, at most, in the country that include neurofeedback</P>
<P>among their services.</P>
<P>The contrast between the strong efficacy of neurofeedback</P>
<P>and the lack of adoption of the technique has led some people</P>
<P>in the field to think that medical associations or pharmaceutical</P>
<P>companies are trying to deliberately undermine it. The techniques</P>
<P>do not fall neatly into either the medical or behavioral</P>
<P>realm and thus both sides reject it. The cost of the therapy is also</P>
<P>front-loaded so that it appears that counseling or pharmaceutical</P>
<P>approaches are cheaper although medical visits, prescription</P>
<P>co-pays, side-effects, and failure to have any impact can become</P>
<P>a costly alternative when a person continues to have symptoms</P>
<P>or a disrupted life for decades.</P>
<P>One barrier to acceptance is the difficulty in explaining exactly</P>
<P>what it is that neurofeedback does and how it works. This</P>
<P>is particularly true for alpha-theta training, which is typically</P>
<P>explained in terms of the relief from life-long traumas in a very</P>
<P>psychodynamic paradigm. People talk about attaining higher</P>
<P>states of consciousness, or having spiritual awakenings and deep</P>
<P>personal insights. It is hard to wrap one’s mind around the fact</P>
<P>that there may be a connection between electrical activity in the</P>
<P>brain and states of consciousness. In addition, the alpha-theta</P>
<P>protocol is actually a mixed bag of techniques including not</P>
<P>only neurofeedback but hand temperature training, relaxation,</P>
<P>counseling, visualization, relapse prevention, refusal skills, hypnotic</P>
<P>suggestion, and considerable one-on-one attention from a</P>
<P>therapist. Although there have been attempts to explain what</P>
<P>happens to cognition, brainwaves, and the soul, the why and</P>
<P>how of the approach are still subject to speculation. The original</P>
<P>alpha-theta approach has evolved over time and researchers in</P>
<P>some of the published work have substantially modified parts of</P>
<P>the original protocol. For instance the Houston study (Burkett,</P>
<P>2006; Burkett et al., 2005) found overall positive results but few</P>
<P>changes on personality profiles; however they had discarded</P>
<P>the temperature training since they did not have the necessary</P>
<P>equipment.</P>
<P>Another notable barrier to acceptance has been the high-tech</P>
<P>nature of the therapy. Instead of counseling, group therapy, or</P>
<P>pharmaceutical interventions this therapy requires a fairly sophisticated</P>
<P>level of technological savvy. The therapist needs to</P>
<P>have high-level computer skills as well as education in how</P>
<P>to attach electrodes, measure impedance levels, and interpret</P>
<P>whether the client understands what to do. Ideally the therapist</P>
<P>is not just a technician but also should have high level counseling</P>
<P>skills since a strong therapeutic alliance may be key. Technical</P>
<P>skills and a warm counseling manner are not always present</P>
<P>in the same person. It takes a motivated and enthusiastic counselor/</P>
<P>clinician to learn this approach. Given that many people</P>
<P>do not know how to use the record function on their VCRs, the</P>
<P>need for technological know-how could be a significant drawback.</P>
<P>However, while neurofeedback has not reached the point</P>
<P>of being completely turnkey, there has been considerable improvement</P>
<P>since the 1980s when buggy software and primitive</P>
<P>instruments were the norm.</P>
<P>Another barrier has been the cost and intensive one-on-one</P>
<P>nature of the therapy. A substance abuse treatment program has</P>
<P>to take into account the cost of equipment and training a practitioner</P>
<P>but also the cost of doing 25 to 50 individual sessions</P>
<P>for each client. The added cost of this therapy could range from</P>
<P>$2,500 to $10,000 depending on the qualifications of the therapist</P>
<P>and whether it is done by a private practitioner or a salaried</P>
<P>clinician in a treatment program. On the other hand, the costbenefit</P>
<P>ratio is high particularly in cases where the there have</P>
<P>been multiple relapses and the person has become a significant</P>
<P>burden to society because of incarceration or health problems</P>
<P>that fall on the tax-paying public. Cri-Help in Los Angeles continues</P>
<P>to have a neurofeedback program but the intake and program</P>
<P>counselors have become adept at picking and choosing</P>
<P>clients who might most benefit from this technique since it is a</P>
<P>limited resource.</P>
<P>Further research (preferably funded through NIH or other</P>
<P>sources) could determine how many sessions are needed as</P>
<P>well as how best to individualize treatment and thus reduce</P>
<P>costs. Increasingly clinicians use quantitative electroencelphagraph</P>
<P>(QEEG) brain maps when beginning to work with clients.</P>
<P>This can reveal comorbid disorders such as traumatic head injuries,</P>
<P>attention deficit disorder, and mood disorders. Systematic</P>
<P>research involving designs that include or exclude certain elements</P>
<P>would help to determine how each aspect contributes to</P>
<P>the whole and thus allow some parts to be discarded or selectively</P>
<P>used. In addition, the proliferation of personal computers</P>
<P>has led to the development of home training machines which</P>
<P>might be used by individuals for interim sessions but under the</P>
<P>general care and direction of a practitioner.</P>
<P>There has been a lack of NIH funding in this field, but discussions</P>
<P>with leaders and practitioners suggests that this may be due</P>
<P>more to inexperience in how one constructs a grant application.</P>
<P>Most neurofeedback therapists are clinicians and do not have</P>
<P>university resources to help them when establishing a research</P>
<P>program. While some grants are working their way through the</P>
<P>system with positive encouragement from NIH project monitors</P>
<P>and peer reviewers, other have been submitted, gotten positive</P>
<P>peer reviews but then the project lost momentum or people</P>
<P>moved on to something else. The NIH grant submission process</P>
<P>is difficult, but most reviewers applaud innovation especially</P>
<P>when it has a potential for high impact.</P>
<P>Siegfried Othmer (personal communication, September</P>
<P>2006) suggests that a reason for the lack of widespread</P>
<P>acceptance is premature discovery. He thinks that if neurofeedback</P>
<P>had been discovered last year it might have gotten more</P>
<P>acceptance in light of emerging research on the brain. Instead,</P>
<P>it is a technique that has been around for nearly 30 years. It has</P>
<P>been occasionally trashed by researchers in related fields (Kline,</P>
<P>Brann, &amp; Loney, 2002) most often with the complaint that there</P>
<P>have been too few controlled studies with random assignment</P>
<P>to groups. Techniques such as Eye Movement Desensitization</P>
<P>and Reprocessing (Levin, Lazrove, &amp; van der Kolk, 1999) and</P>
<P>“journaling,” (Pennebaker, 2003; Pennebaker&amp;Graybeal, 2001;</P>
<P>Pennebaker &amp; Seagal, 1999) have had an easier time being accepted,</P>
<P>perhaps because they are simple techniques.</P>
<P>Neurofeedback for substance abuse is a promising approach</P>
<P>with potential for treating difficult and resistant addicts who</P>
<P>have gone through the revolving door of treatment many times.</P>
<P>Beyond that, it has the potential for helping us learn about fundamental</P>
<P>mind/body interactions and connections and even understand</P>
<P>some of the mysteries connecting traumatic life events</P>
<P>and substance abuse.</P>
