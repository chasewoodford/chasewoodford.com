<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Sleep is a most powerful human drive.&nbsp; All adults really do need 8 hours of sleep and there is little variation on that requirement.&nbsp; People are not good judges of their own performance levels when it comes to sleep deprivation.&nbsp; So, when someone says they get by just fine on 6 hours of sleep, it means they are not bothered by lack of sleep.&nbsp; That is, they just don’t know. But poor sleep ages the body and impairs all cognitive and emotional functions.&nbsp; <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Brainwave biofeedback training professionals concur that the most common client report about neurofeedback is better quality sleep. &nbsp;Some emphasize the importance of re-establishing circadian rhythms or the arousal levels that vary during the day and night.&nbsp; &nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">During sleep there are typically 4 or 5 up and down cycles in overall arousal lasting 60-90 minutes.&nbsp; Dreams and REM sleep occur at the most wakeful stage while the muscles are numbed.&nbsp; The heart and brain never stop working.&nbsp; But at the deepest level of sleep, the brain rests by letting large neural networks all fire at the same slow rate.&nbsp; </P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">The brain relaxes most when 50% of the brain cells play follow the leader. This is very restorative for the central nervous system.&nbsp; But the deepest level of sleep is rare among adults in the big city.&nbsp; Most people get 30% of their neurons to all relax at the same time.&nbsp; Those with sleep disorders may never get close to regular cycles with deep stages of sleep.&nbsp; </P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">All sleep problems can be dealt with by calming down jittery brainwave activity while awake.&nbsp; Brainwave biofeedback shows the brain that it can discard excess commotion without a problem.&nbsp; You need biofeedback to learn that lesson. &nbsp;Then you need biofeedback practice to stop making wasted effort that disturbs sleep.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">This is a powerful form of stress reduction or relaxation training.&nbsp; Training so powerful that the results last for a lifetime. When the mind discovers a better way to operate, it recognizes it, accepts it and adopts the more efficient mode of operation.&nbsp; We all try too hard to get the job done.&nbsp; </P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Reducing the overall level of mental turbulence allows sleep to come more quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lessening the excess noise in the brain allows sleep to be maintained until it is time to wake up.&nbsp; </P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Brainwave biofeedback has been shown to be effective for other sleep disorders as well.&nbsp; <STRONG>Restless leg syndrome</STRONG> is a strange disorder that may be completely unconscious.&nbsp; When it is conscious it may be experienced as a tingling or burning in the leg, knee or foot.&nbsp; The bed mate may experience restless leg syndrome as kicking during sleep.&nbsp; Sometimes this is both discovered and resolved during neurofeedback training.&nbsp; </P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><STRONG>Sleep apnea</STRONG> also seems to respond well to neurofeedback training, but not at the 80% rate that is common for other disorders.&nbsp; Sleep apnea is more than loud snoring.&nbsp; The problem in sleep apnea is when the relaxation of sleep causes airway blockage and breathing stops for a while. As lack of air causes panic, you begin to wake up.&nbsp; This arousal allows the air to flow again and sleepy relaxation returns.&nbsp; It is not unusual for this cycle to happen hundreds of times per night!&nbsp; There is often no deep sleep, just skimming the surface between unconscious sleep and unconscious panic.&nbsp; After 8 hours of quiet battle you are still sleep deprived.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">There are several kinds of remedies for sleep apnea.&nbsp; The most often effective remedy is a continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) mask and motorized pump.&nbsp; Like blowing up a balloon, air pressure keeps the airway open but does not interfere with breathing.&nbsp; It may interfere with sleep and the compliance rate for CPAP is about 50%.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Another remedy is a dental appliance that is held in the mouth like a boxer’s mouthpiece.&nbsp; There are a few strategies here for the custom-made device.&nbsp; Some pull out the tongue.&nbsp; Mostly they jut the lower jaw forward.&nbsp; To get a feel for how this works, just try snoring right now.&nbsp; Next try it with your tongue out.&nbsp; Now stick out your jaw and try snoring.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>While a dental appliance usually helps, it may not help enough.&nbsp; The cost is often about $1000 and is usually not covered by insurance.&nbsp; </P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">There are surgical procedures that remove various tissues that obstruct the airway.&nbsp; Ask hard questions about effectiveness before going under the knife for sleep apnea.&nbsp; </P>
