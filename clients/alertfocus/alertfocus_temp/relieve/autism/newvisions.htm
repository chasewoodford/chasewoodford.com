<p><span class="page"></span></p><h2>Biofeedback &amp; Autism </h2><i>
<p align="center">by Gary Ames, Appeared in New Visions Magazine, Nov. Dec., 2006</p></i><b>
</b><p align="justify"><b>Johnny, age 7, was fascinated for hours by running water, lost in his own world. </b>Like
 many autistic children he ran on his toes and flapped his hands to 
self-stimulate in hopes of controlling all the noise in his head. Even 
minor frustrations turned into emotional meltdowns including seizures. </p>
<p align="justify">When Johnny came to his first brain biofeedback 
sessions he would retreat under the chairs. He did not talk or read. One
 year and 60 sessions later he makes friends wherever he goes and acts 
like the Mayor of the waiting room. All his autistic symptoms have now 
disappeared except that he is reading one year behind grade level. He 
now hugs his mommy out of his love for her. </p>
<p align="justify">Autism is a severe lifelong neuro-biological disorder
 characterized by limitations of communication and socialization. Autism
 has grown at an alarming rate from 5 in 10,000 births in 1970 up to 1 
in 166 births in 2003. Little is known about the cause of autism and 
related disorders on the Autism spectrum such as Asperger’s. </p>
<p align="justify">Autistic infants typically grow normally for 12-18 
months and then begin losing social and communication skills. The 
ability to imitate disappears. There is usually poor expressive language
 skills. An autistic child’s outward expression never includes the triad
 of facial expression, word and gesture. These children do not socialize
 with others on the playground. Rather than a true relationships, 
interactions are utilitarian. Autistic children use people as tools, for
 example bringing mom to the refrigerator and guiding her hand to get 
food. </p>
<p align="justify">Scientific research and clinical practice are showing
 brain biofeedback to be a very promising remedy for autism spectrum 
disorders. All biofeedback starts with monitoring an aspect of your 
body’s functioning and consists of interacting with a display of your 
physiology. For example, as people are relaxing their hands grow warmer.
 Imagine holding a digital thermometer in your fingers and letting your 
hand temperature go up as you relax. Biofeedback is natural, benign and 
non-invasive. Adverse effects from biofeedback are rare and minor such 
as a brief headache. </p>
<p align="justify">The most exciting research for autism is with brain 
biofeedback, called neurofeedback. For 35 years brain wave biofeedback 
has used software connected to an EEG to produce significant improvement
 in numerous disorders including seizures, migraine, and ADHD. Long term
 follow ups show that results are sustained and that people can shed 
their medications. </p>
<p align="justify">Recent research is proving that neurofeedback also 
reduces the symptoms of autism. One recent study reported a 92% success 
rate with an average 42% reduction in autistic symptoms. We know that 
biofeedback generally enhances self-regulation. Speculation about how 
neurofeedback works includes fostering self-repair of communication 
pathways and promoting maturation of brain functions. </p>
<p align="justify">The newest form of neurofeedback is called 
hemoencephalography (blood-brain-image) or HEG. HEG is proving 
especially effective for autism. Infrared heat sensors on the head can 
detect blood flow within the brain. In HEG biofeedback sessions you 
train to increase either blood perfusion or oxygenation at specific 
sites such as the frontal cortex. Infrared photos show the effect to 
last for days and the total effect to be cumulative. </p>
<p align="justify">HEG training seems to work like exercise that 
irrigates underdeveloped areas of the brain. Think of adding more RAM 
into your computer. Greater brain metabolism becomes improved neural 
function which shows up as better behavior and new levels of 
achievement.Progress from neurofeedback tends to be across the board 
spanning: frustration tolerance, habits, sleep, cognitive, social, 
emotional, behavioral and executive mental functioning. </p>
<p align="justify">As technology advances specific neurofeedback 
strategies and combinations are still being developed. Some 
neurofeedback practitioners focus on correcting brain wave amplitudes 
and bringing them in line with norms. Some use EEG brain maps to guide 
their training of certain frequencies at particular parts of the scalp; 
others use symptoms to guide placement and frequencies. For example if 
there are too many fast beta waves in the occipital cortex 
(corresponding to a busy mind) then sensors would be placed on the back 
of the head and the client would play computer games that reward reduced
 activity at 23-38 Hz. </p>
<p align="justify">Other professionals train down excess variability of 
EEG signals across the entire spectrum of brain waves at central 
locations on the scalp. A few practitioners have clients perform various
 types of mental processing challenges while training such as reading or
 listening to stories. </p>
<p align="justify">In addition to brain wave amplitudes, inter-site 
coherence can be a goal of EEG biofeedback training. The idea here is 
that you don’t want too much nor too little correspondence between 
activity at separate sites within the brain. Specialized brain maps 
indicate abnormality of co-modulation between each pair of 19 sites. 
This mapping guides training to normalize this aspect of the EEG. All of
 these methods and other approaches are integrated into the 
neurofeedback regimen in several ways depending on the case and the 
practitioner. A standard of practice has not been defined. </p>
<p align="justify">Using any variety of neurofeedback approaches, we see
 near complete success for 90% of those with migraines in 20 sessions. 
Garden variety ADD takes 40 sessions to clear up for 80% of clients. 
Autistic spectrum disorders are more severe and take a larger number of 
sessions to produce more modest results. </p>
<p align="justify">Biofeedback software is now so advanced that it is 
fairly easy to use. The price of equipment has come down so that it has 
become practical for some parents to do neurofeedback training in their 
home under the guidance of a professional. </p>
<p align="justify">No one is talking about a complete "cure" for autism.
 However clinical successes and experimental research are progressing 
just as it has for the several other disorders that neurofeedback has 
virtually conquered. For autism, there is promising scientific research 
of significant improvement and reports of seriously impaired clients 
like Johnny completing neurofeedback training with no more autistic 
symptoms whatsoever.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i></p><i>
