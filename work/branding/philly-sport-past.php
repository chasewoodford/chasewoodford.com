                        PhillySportPast is a website dedicated to breeding "4-for-4" Philly sports fans through education and interaction. The website is backed by a huge database of Philly sports' events, trivia and factoids. It features links to nearly every Philly sports figure and athlete, past and present, as well as interactive games and activities where users can score points and battle other Philly sports fans for free prizes.

                        I was approached by the client&mdash;who already had an idea of what would make for a good mark for the PhillySportPast brand&mdash;for help creating the company's logo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea for the logo the client originally suggested was great&mdash;an image of Ben Franklin wearing eye-black&mdash;and is ultimately what the final logo ended up being. But we wanted to go through a process of exploration, regardless, for validation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I sat with the client in a brainstorming session where the challenge was proposed: here is my original idea, let's see if we can think of something better. We put a bunch good ideas down on paper. I created draft versions of a couple of those ideas in Photoshop. The client and I went back and forth over the course of a couple weeks discussing what we liked and didn't like about each concept.
                    <p>
                    <p>
                        It quickly became apparent during our process of design exploration that, more than anything, the PhillySportPast logo had to do two things. One, it had to quickly connect the concepts of Philadelphia and sports. And two, it had to stand on its own when the brand's name could not be included.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were other considerations, too. The client wanted a logo that was color-agnostic, meaning the logo's colors could change from one to another to match the team colors of whatever sport was in season. Likewise, the client also wanted the font of the logo to have a Philadelphian feel to it. Lastly, the logo needed to be easily recognizable in a large range of sizes, from 16px to 250px square <a href="http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2012/11/12/final-social-media-sizing-cheat-sheet/" title="The Ultimate Complete Final Social Media Sizing Cheat Sheet" target="_blank">and everything in between<sup><i class="icon-popup" aria-hidden="true"></i></sup></a>. As mentioned above, this meant with and without the brand's name in text.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img class="left highlight" src="../../images/highlight-phillySportPast-001.png" alt="PhillySportPast logo"/>
                        Having settled on a mark for the brand, it was time to add a unique PhillySportPast touch to <a href="http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/brush/ben.htm" target="_blank">Joseph Siffred Duplessis's classic Franklin portrait<sup><i class="icon-popup" aria-hidden="true"></i></sup></a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vectorizing is the process of taking a raster image, like the digital version of Joseph Siffred Duplessis's portrait of Franklin found online, and turning it into scalable objects (lines and curves) defined by mathematical equations as opposed to pixels. Vectorizing an image eliminates much of the photo-realism of the image, but provides the benefit of being easily and accurately scalable. I would also consider vector imagery as one of the more popular types of imagery in recent popular culture, as opposed to photographic, 3D or hand-drawn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In most cases, the process of vectorization is quite involved. For the PhillySportPast logo, I took a digital copy of Joseph Siffred Duplessis's portrait and did a two-color trace in Adobe Illustrator, tweaking the settings until I had a rough outline of all the defining facial features that give Ben Franklin his defined look. From there, it was a matter of editing each of the hundreds of paths and anchor points to make sure the flattened image looked good regardless of how far up or down it was scaled. That process of refinement took several days. Finally, it was time to add what would be the signature PhillySportPast touch to the mark&mdash;the eye black.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This part also took quite a bit of time to get right. The ultimate goal was to make the strokes of eye black look as realistic as possible&mdash;tough to do with the shape of a cheekbone as prominent as Franklin's and no helpful visual cues to guide the stroke due to the image's light source casting no shadows on the right side of his face&mdash;to make the strokes look effortless, as if the eye black was part of the original image and not "Photoshopped". First, a brush with the right stroke had to be selected. The brush needed a stroke that looked like a finger smear. If you know anything about Illustrator/Photoshop brushes, you know there are hundreds available to choose from, and each only a shade different from another. Equally important to selecting the right brush is getting the stroke itself right. I must admit, I put together quite the catalog of football stars sporting eye black for reference.
