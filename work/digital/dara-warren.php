                    <p>
                        A friend of mine approached me for help building her website. She is a brilliant, creative person I got to know initially through work. She recently went part-time so that she could devote more time to her work as an artist. Specifically, writing. She writes children's and young-adult's literature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She had begun aggressively shopping her writing around with agents and publishers and was receiving a lot of positive feedback. But she noticed one thing that most of the authors she admired had that she didn't&mdash;a web presence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were times agents would ask how they could find her on the web or publishers could see more of her work and, unfortunately, she could offer them nothing more than her e-mail address. So she called on me to help her create a site where she could introduce herself and, most importantly, showcase her work. In her words, having a website made her "feel like less of a phony".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The task was relatively simple and had few limitations. One, like most clients, she wanted to get as much out of her website as she could for the cheapest amount. Two, she wanted to bait agents and publishers with excerpts of her work but, for obvious reasons, did not want to publish entire pieces on her site. That, combined with the fact that a lot of her stories are picture books, meant we had to get creative with what we published online.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working on this project was extremely rewarding&mdash;learning about the ebb and flow of the publishing industry vicariously through a good friend; learning how to make the biggest impact with minimal resources; seeing first hand how website design affects client empowerment and confidence.

                        { GoDaddy website builder }
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img class="right highlight" src="../../images/highlight-daraWarren-001.png" alt="GoDaddy website builder"/>
                        The client had purchased a domain through GoDaddy. Specifically, GoDaddy's Website Builder Personal, a five-page website deal. She paid about $10 for her domain and $3 for her hosting for her first year. I hate to say it, but it really is true: you get what you pay for. GoDaddy's website builder was quite a challenge to work with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a designer, it is difficult to work with for several reasons. You are required to pick from a template before adding content to your site. Each template has unique features. But the problem is, the base template&mdash;the fonts, colors and other styles&mdash;is not directly editable. There is no stylesheet you can edit (probably because most novices wouldn't know how to edit one). Some text sizes, colors and styles are editable using the built-in toolbar, but options for customization are limited. Likewise, the WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get, or 'wiz-ee-wig') editor features drag-and-drop modules that allowed for very little customization. For example, the contact form was a contact form; no adding or removing labels or inputs without some serious CSS/JavaScript hacking. Pretty much every change to the template we wanted to make required a ton of extra code to make happen. And because we picked a template we liked the most, but one that we ultimately ended up re-writing top to bottom, the limited functionality of the website builder basically doubled the amount of time it took to design the site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a developer, the website builder is difficult to work with for several other reasons. Because we wanted to customize the site, we had to build our own CSS file to overwrite all the template styles. However, the styles from our custom stylesheet wouldn't apply to the site until it was published. Meaning, we couldn't adjust our stylesheet and see changes instantly, or even when in preview mode. Each time we made a change to the stylesheet we had to publish and re-load the site outside of GoDaddy's website builder to see the changes in action. Having to do this a hundred times a day really takes the wind out of the sails. Not to mention "hot-coding" is a really poor practice. Likewise, having the site look one way inside the website builder and completely different outside meant developing blindly, in a guess-and-check fashion, which also really slowed things down. The website builder, like most WYSIWYG editors, relies solely on the absolute positioning of everything. Also bad news. This means even the slightest change to content potentially throws off the entire design. This also means you have to place elements in weird places in the WYSIWYG editor because you know that styles from your custom stylesheet will later align the element correctly once applied outside the website builder. One of the other issues I found with GoDaddy's website builder was the automated mobile view, that could either be enabled or disabled, but not customized and only slightly editable. Meaning you have the choice of displaying your page in either a poorly, mistmatching design loosely optimized for mobile devices or as it would display in a desktop browser with no optimization for mobile at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By now you can probably tell how much I loved working with GoDaddy. I found the website builder horrendously difficult to work with, but imagine it is probably the perfect tool for most of the people who pay $13 annually for their website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In case you were wondering, with the Website Builder Personal package you get no access to root files or template code, no FTP access, no database storage and no hosting beyond the images you upload through the WYSIWYG editor (1GB max).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would never recommend GoDaddy as a domain/hosting option for any client. In all honesty, I would turn down most projects that required editing through a WYSIWYG editor, especially a GoDaddy hosted one, but made an exception here for a friend in need. I learned a lot from the experience, but would not put even my worst enemy through the same.
